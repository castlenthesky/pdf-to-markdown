# Negotiation: Strategies for Success

## Chapter 1: The Importance of Negotiation

The simple question asked in this book is: Are you ready to negotiate at the drop of a hat? If your answer is anything but "Yes, certainly," then please read on. One false move in negotiations of major importance, such as salary negotiations, house buying, or car buying, can have a dramatic negative consequence on your economic welfare for years to come. Given that your quality of life is affected by your ability to bring home the bacon as well as eat it in quiet dignity, knowing how to negotiate in the corporate world and in the kitchen is essential for peace of mind and retirement.

This book does three things: First, it provides a game plan that works in any negotiation situation: dispel the faulty belief that negotiations in boardrooms or real estate deals are fundamentally different from salary negotiations, school and community negotiations, and, yes, negotiations with spouses and kids. Chances are, if you are great at making real estate deals, then you also will be great at negotiating with a caterer for your local charity's fundraiser.

Second, this book focuses on the two tasks of any negotiation: how to create win-win deals by leveraging information carefully collected from the other party, and how to effectively lay claim to part of the win-win goldmine. A key part of negotiation is being informed.

Finally, this book talks about how to handle less-than-perfect situations, such as when you make a threat (that you did not really mean), how to establish trust with someone you don't trust, how to walk away at the right time, and negotiating with people you don't really like, or at the other end of the spectrum, those you love very much.

Negotiation does not just occur in used car lots, boardrooms, or lawyers' offices. You negotiate every day: with your spouse to split up household tasks, with your colleagues regarding who will take a client's call, with your young kids to determine the best time for bed. Any time meeting your goals requires the cooperation of others, you must negotiate.

Sometimes you have significant time to prepare for a negotiation. But other times you get blindsided: You get a call from an old friend with a "hot" business opportunity. Or you receive a disturbing email from a colleague claiming resources you believe to be yours. Or your nanny or assistant threatens to leave unless you give her a raise and a three-week vacation. In all these situations, you may feel there's no time to prepare for negotiation. But even if you've only an hour—or just moments—to prepare, there are several crucial steps you have to take:

1. Identify your goals.
2. Brainstorm your options.
3. Plan your opening move.

### Get in Touch with Your Goals

Negotiators are often quick to stake out a position. A position is a demand, such as, "I want a bonus check!" The danger in stating a position is that it can lead the other party to stake out a position, such as, "No way, I'm not paying you a bonus!"

Conversely, negotiators who move past positions to focus on their interests usually achieve their goals. A real goal reflects a negotiator's interests and answers the "why" question. Take the case of two colleagues negotiating who gets the more spacious office in a suite: It would be easy for both colleagues to say, "I want the bigger office." That is a demand. If the colleagues articulate why they desire the bigger office, they are getting closer to stating their goals. For example, one colleague might want the larger office because it would allow her to have team meetings that are currently impossible to schedule in the conference room, and she is under pressure to deliver on a deadline. The other colleague might want the office to impress important clients.

People's demands may be incompatible, but their goals might be compatible or at least complementary. For example, if the two colleagues articulate their goals, they might create an arrangement in which they share the big office, reserving it for meetings with clients.

### Brainstorm Your Options

Negotiations do not always end in mutual settlement. A colleague may refuse to share the big office, the nanny may quit, the company may not take your offer. So you need to face the thorny question of what you would do in the absence of agreement. In short, what are your alternative courses of action? Most people have tunnel vision when it comes to their alternative courses of action and can't see all the different paths through the forest. Identify your options using the four fundamental rules of brainstorming:

- Suspend your initial judgment and just list all options that come to mind, even outlandish ones.
- Strive for quantity; often, a good idea emerges from several silly-sounding ones.
- Reserve judgment and evaluation until later.

### Plan Your Opening Move

Your opening offer should clearly articulate your goal and suggest how to reach it. ("I would like the corner office because my client load is highest in the office, and my team is unable to fit in the current space.") You don't need to blurt out your opening offer the moment you meet with the other party. But, at some point, after you exchange pleasantries or perhaps even after the other party places something on the table, it will be your turn to anchor the negotiation.

Your opening offer should represent the ideal situation for you. State it clearly, but do not position your offer as a demand. One direct but nondemanding way of doing this is, "In the spirit of getting the discussion started, I've mapped out a set of terms that works for me," or "I have prepared a proposal that I would like to get your reaction to."

Be firm on your interests but flexible on how to achieve them. Don't make take-it-or-leave-it demands. If you are feeling demanding or indignant before the negotiation, rehearse an opening that you might present to someone you care about (such as your spouse or friend), even if you don't particularly care about the other party. The danger of making insulting, take-it-or-leave-it offers is that most people will opt to leave it.

## Chapter 2: Becoming a Skilled Negotiator

I have never met a natural-born negotiator. The best negotiators I've met have been self-made, not manufactured by their parents. People can adapt and improve with conscious effort, and, in fact, that is the only path to becoming a good negotiator.

Nevertheless, a great number of people believe successful negotiation is all in the DNA, and that negotiation, like leadership, is something you're born with.

You don't have to travel far to see that the right kind of experience can dramatically improve your negotiation outcomes. The "magic" when it comes to experiences that enhance negotiation skills is the I-C-E rule:

- Give immediate feedback (preferably within one hour).
- Make the feedback clear to the point of indisputability.
- Give the negotiator the tools to be more effective.

Negotiation is something you can practice and improve upon. If, immediately after a simulation (within 20 minutes), someone could score you, interpret your score as clearly as possible, and give you a toolbox to ensure you didn't repeat mistakes, you would, with repetition, improve your negotiation skills. People's scores usually improve dramatically, by over 20 percent on average.

As you read this book, I suggest you follow the advice given to the person who asked how to get to Carnegie Hall: Practice. Test the skills of each truth, and, if possible, get prompt, clear feedback, and you will find yourself becoming more effective. Try negotiating on a personal level and test yourself. The more time and effort you put into trying out the various points and techniques shared, the more prepared you will be.

Your ability to do well in life's most important negotiations isn't determined by your basic personality or genetic structure. It is most strongly determined by a simple factor: your level of motivation to improve yourself.

## Chapter 3: The Power of Preparation

Most people look for a magic bullet when it comes to negotiation, and well, there is one. Are you ready? Here it is: Prepare. After years of offering this advice, sending people off, and expecting magic to occur that never did, I finally realized the problem: Rehearsing does not equal preparation.

There are two styles of preparation, and only one of them works. Let's call the two styles Pattern X and Pattern Y.

### Pattern X Preparation

These activities seem to be useful but aren't:

- Rehearsing your demands.
- Pumping yourself up.
- Making a personal pledge to yourself or your partner to act tough.
- Figuring out how to throw the other negotiators off or make them feel uncomfortable, which includes rearranging furniture (putting their chairs in odd positions).
- Preparing backhanded compliments and outright insults.
- Rehearsing phrases that include, "This is my final offer," "My bottom line," "This is a deal-breaker," "Nonnegotiable," or "Then we don't have a deal."
- Framing your opening offer as a demand.

### Pattern Y Preparation

These activities are extraordinarily useful, but negotiators often don't engage in them:

- Listing all issues under consideration (e.g., payment, terms and conditions, indemnities, volume, distribution).
- Arranging those issues in order of importance or priority to you (either by using a simple rank-order or allocating 100 points among the issues to reflect what percentage of overall importance each represents).
- For each issue, brainstorming all the alternatives (for example, payment terms might range from 0 percent down to paid-in-full).
- Brainstorming issues the other party might bring up.
- Identifying your most desirable set of terms for each of the issues.
- Identifying and prioritizing alternative courses of action to negotiating with this person (for example, liquidating your product).
- Identifying the other party's potential alternative courses of action.
- Preparing an opening offer as a way of starting discussions.

If negotiators did even a subset of these activities to prepare for a negotiation, they would fare dramatically better than if they didn't. In other words, Pattern Y negotiators have measurably better outcomes than do Pattern X negotiators. Pattern X is more likely to strike out; Pattern Y gets you to yes.

The question, then, is how to get people to follow Pattern Y when most of them are used to Pattern X? Clearly, relying on natural instinct won't work. So let me suggest you use a strategy I call guided preparation. If unguided preparation is allowing negotiators to do whatever they want, guided preparation is giving them a step-by-step method to follow. Jeanne Brett at the Kellogg School devised an easy-to-follow model that you can use. It works like this:

1. List all the issues to be negotiated in the first column. (Be ready to add issues the other party brings up.)
2. For each of the issues listed, in the second column, indicate its relative importance to you (use either a rank order or allocate 100 points among the issues), your most desired terms, and your underlying interests.
3. For all issues, in the third column, make your best guess about the counterparty's interests, rankings, and most desired terms.

If you have accomplished these three things, you can get to yes.

## Chapter 4: The Power of Making the First Offer

Conventional negotiation wisdom strictly cautions negotiators against opening first to avoid tipping their hands. If everyone does this, you are liable to end up in a comical cat-and-mouse game in which both parties develop elaborate methods to avoid answering any questions as long as possible and eventually walk away without a deal.

I don't know the origin of this bad advice, but I'd like to banish it right now. I researched the scientific literature and explored numerous studies that have investigated negotiators' offer patterns and outcomes. In none of those investigations did it harm negotiators to open first. In fact, it appears to always benefit negotiators to open first. One caveat: In the rare and undesirable situation in which the other party knows more about you than you know about them, it is a disadvantage to open first.

### Why Does It Work to Open First?

Your opening offer acts as a powerful psychological anchor in a negotiation. It carries a lot of weight. Your opening represents the most you can (usually) hope to get. Don't underestimate how important opening offers are. Indeed, negotiators' first offers can generally predict the outcome of a negotiation: Adam Galinsky and Tomas Mussweiler found that first offers correlate as much as 85 percent of the time with outcomes.

Many negotiators live in fear of the winner's curse, believing that the counterparty will gleefully and immediately accept their first offer. Don't come to the silly conclusion that you can make outrageous offers and expect to do well. Unfortunately, offers wildly outside the zone of possible agreement (ZOPA) lose their anchoring power and lead to a chilling effect, where a negotiator grows cold on a deal because they feel that the other party is not bargaining in good faith, or even the boomerang effect, which occurs when a ridiculous offer invites an equally ridiculous counteroffer, often as a matter of spite. For these reasons, your ideal offer should be close to the other party's barely acceptable terms.

### No One Is Going to Accept Your First Offer, So Making a Concession Is Inevitable

Strategically speaking, your aspiration point should be slightly worse (for the other party) than your guess about the other party's best alternative to negotiated agreement (BATNA). The logic: No one is going to accept your first offer that matches the other party's barely acceptable terms, so you'll never end up there. It's best, then, to open with a figure slightly worse than the counterparty's barely acceptable terms. If your opening offer is dramatically worse, you create a chilling effect. If it is just a bit worse, you are in the domain of the counterparty's acceptability range. Offers in this range are, by definition, not insulting.

## Chapter 5: Responding to the Other Party's Offer

Once you know that scientific evidence supports the negotiator who makes the first offer, you may go so far as to cover your ears when you realize that the other party is about to present you with an opening offer.

But it's not wise to tune the other party out if they are ready to make you an offer. A better strategy is simply to remind yourself of your own first offer before the other party delivers theirs. Preparing your opening offer is your best defense. Under typical conditions, however, most people haven't prepared their opening and are swept out to sea when the other party opens first.

Here are some handy points to think about in advance:

- If you haven't prepared an opening offer, you shouldn't be at the bargaining table. Remember, your opening offer is a behavioral manifestation of your aspiration point. So it's imperative to prepare your opening offer.
- If you state your opening offer like a demand, you should fear either the chilling or the boomerang effect (discussed in Chapter 4, "The Power of Making the First Offer"). However, you can make your offer in a nondemanding way. Here's how I do it in my personal negotiations:

  > In the spirit of recognizing how important your time is, I have prepared a set of terms that would be acceptable to me. I understand, however, that you will most likely have some different ideas. So I offer this set of terms (which I have written on the flip chart over here) as a starting point for what is a more broad-ranging discussion. And, in that spirit, I am eager to hear your ideas.

- Suppose that the other party has indeed beaten you to the punch and has made one heck of an opening offer. In that case, I would say:

  > Thanks for sharing your ideas with me. I've also spent some time preparing a set of terms that would work for me. I will warn you that my terms are dramatically different from the ones you've offered. But in the spirit of recognizing the value of your time and working with you, I am ready to fully discuss all terms.

- Always write down your opening offer so you can continue to refer to it during the discussion.
- Okay, you got tongue-tied; everyone does occasionally. So, here's an idea: Always find a way to share your ideas. Anchors work dramatically better when you write your opening offer on a flip chart or blackboard.

## Chapter 6: Balancing Cooperation and Competition

Most people are under the impression that to succeed in negotiation, they have to be tough or competitive. This makes many people uncomfortable because they want to succeed in negotiation but don't like acting tough. So, many opt to be cooperative, because they want the other party to like and trust them, and frankly, it's just more comfortable. The downside: They often perform less well economically.

Some people act cooperative during simulated negotiations because it's more natural for them but then feel like "chumps" when their outcomes are poor. Other people have the opposite problem. They cannot see any wisdom in being cooperative, so they act very competitively during the negotiations and then wonder why no one is being cooperative with them.

Do you want to be tough and competitive or nice and cooperative? Do you want to succeed or do you want to build relationships?

I firmly believe that tough versus nice is a false choice. You don't have to choose between them. To be a skilled negotiator, you do need to be fluent in the languages of both cooperation and competition. Let's examine "creating value" and "claiming value" in more detail.

- **Creating Value**: Creating value refers to "win-win" negotiation. It is the process of developing deals that represent mutual gains for all parties involved. To create value, we need to cooperate with the other parties and genuinely work with their interests in mind.

  Management guru Mary Parker Follett tells the story of two sisters and an orange, so ultra-competitive that the only agreement they can reach is to split the orange in half. One sister squeezes the juice from her half to make fresh orange juice and discards the peel. The other sister grates her half of the peel for an orange scone recipe and throws out the juice. In the heat of the argument, they overlooked a simple win-win solution: One sister gets the whole peel, the other all the juice. By the time they realize this, the orange is gone. By acting purely competitively, the "Orange Sisters" turned an easy win-win into a lose-lose. According to negotiation gurus Roger Fisher and Bill Ury, who wrote the book *Getting to Yes*, the two sisters communicated only their positions, not their interests.

- **Claiming Value**: Sometimes people get so carried away creating value that they forget about their own bottom lines. Claiming value, then, refers to how negotiators garner resources for themselves and their companies. No one wants to get no part of the orange or just a sliver. It's necessary to make claims in a negotiation. But making claims is different from making demands.

Most people falsely believe that creating value (cooperating) and claiming value (competing) are opposite ends of the same continuum:

**COMPETITIVE | COOPERATIVE**

I disagree. It's simultaneously possible to be competitive and cooperative. The best state of affairs is to have a negotiator who is cooperative in working with the other party to understand and explore their issues and interests and competitive enough to claim valuable resources for themselves.
