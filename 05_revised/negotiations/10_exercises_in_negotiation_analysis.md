# Exercises in Negotiation Analysis

This set of exercises highlights two important analytical concepts in negotiation analysis: Pareto efficiency and the relationship between BATNAs (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement), reservation prices, and ZOPAs (Zone of Possible Agreement).

## A Primer on BATNAs, Reservation Prices, and ZOPAs

Your BATNA, or Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement, is the course of action you would take if you do not reach an agreement. If you do not reach agreement with a prospective employer, alternatives might include a specific job at a different firm, a possibly protracted job search, entering graduate school, or perhaps remaining at your current job. The alternative you would choose if faced with this decision is your BATNA. Sometimes a BATNA is a simple alternative or a sure thing, such as 'a 1986 Toyota Tercel from my friend Sarah for $1,350.' Other times, a BATNA is a course of action or a set of decisions contingent on the resolution of uncertainty: 'negotiate with my friend Sarah for her 1986 Toyota Tercel; I will buy it from her if I can negotiate a deal under $1,350, otherwise I will buy a new Tercel at the local dealer for $13,240.'

Obviously, the goal of the negotiation is to do better than your BATNA. In other words, any deal you reach should be preferred to what you would do if you do not settle. In negotiations that involve only one issue, usually money, a closely related concept is the reservation price. In a specific negotiation, you are indifferent between settling at your reservation price and your BATNA. Obviously, you should try to do better than your reservation price if you can. A reservation price just establishes a threshold (for the buyer, a maximum; for the seller, a minimum) for settlement.

Determining your reservation price is not always easy. It means that you have to put a value on your best alternative. Suppose your BATNA in a job negotiation with XYZ company is "look around for a job in the media industry; if I am unable to find a job that pays over $25,000 within 2 months, I will return to graduate school." To value the BATNA, you must assess (formally or informally) the likelihood that you will find a job that pays $25,000 within 2 months, as well as value in relative terms three possible consequences: a job with XYZ, a job in the media industry that pays over $25,000, and a return to graduate school. Your reservation price should also factor in other possible concerns such as anxiety and risk aversion (i.e., dislike of the uncertainty of not knowing whether you will have a job), legal and transaction costs, etc.

The reservation price is negotiation-specific. To illustrate, suppose that you are trying to buy a used car and your BATNA is a 1986 Toyota Tercel from my friend Sarah for $1,350. Let's say that you value a 1985 Toyota Tercel $150 less than a 1986 Toyota Tercel, but value a 1986 Toyota Corolla $300 more than a Tercel of the same year. If you are negotiating for the 1985 Tercel, your reservation price is $1,200. In other words, you are indifferent between buying a 1985 Tercel for $1,200 and buying a 1986 Tercel for $1,350. On the other hand, your reservation price for a 1986 Corolla is $1,650.

In simple negotiations involving just one issue, the seller has a reservation price SRP (the least the seller would accept) and the buyer has a reservation price BRP (the most the buyer would pay). If SRP > BRP, then a deal is impossible. On the other hand, if SRP â‰¤ BRP, then a deal is possible. In this case, we say that there is a ZOPA or Zone of Possible Agreement, the interval from SRP to BRP.

## Exercises on BATNAs, Reservation Prices, and ZOPAs

1. Jewel Equipment manufactures magnetic card readers for medical applications. A critical component of the card reader is the CPU (central processing unit). Jewel's card reader can use two standard types of CPUs, Z-1 and Z-2. Although the Z-1 and Z-2 CPUs are identical in terms of the finished card reader's functionality, for complex technical reasons, the Z-1 works slightly better in Jewel's manufacturing process, resulting in fewer rejects and disruptions to the manufacturing process. Jewel's industrial engineers have estimated the benefits of Z-1 over Z-2 at about $5/unit.

Jewel is in the process of procuring a 3-month supply of CPUs. Acme, a leading manufacturer of CPUs, has offered to sell Jewel Z-2 CPUs at $35/unit, whereas Beta, another CPU producer, has quoted Jewel a price of $38/unit for its Z-1 CPUs. Jewel is about to begin negotiations with a third firm, Condor, which only manufactures the Z-2 CPU.

Assume for Questions 1a and 1b that Acme and Beta have quoted firm prices.

- **a.** In negotiating with Condor, what is Jewel's BATNA?
- **b.** In negotiating with Condor, what is Jewel's reservation price, i.e., the most it will pay for Condor's Z-2 CPU?

Now assume that although Beta's price is firm, your purchasing manager believes that there is a 50% chance that she might be able to negotiate a 20% reduction from Acme (to $28/unit).

- **c.** How has Jewel's BATNA changed?
- **d.** Assume that Jewel makes decisions on the basis of Expected Monetary Value (EMV). What is Jewel's reservation price for Condor's Z-2 CPU?

Condor's largest customer, representing 40% of Condor's sales, recently declared bankruptcy. As a result, Condor has an excess supply of Z-2 CPUs. If Condor is unable to sell its supply of Z-2 CPUs to Jewel, Condor estimates that there is a 20% chance that they will be able to sell the CPUs to one of Jewel's competitors for $30/CPU and an 80% chance that they will have to liquidate their stock for $15/CPU.

- **e.** What is Condor's BATNA?
- **f.** What is Condor's reservation price? Assume that Condor makes decisions on the basis of Expected Monetary Value (EMV).
- **g.** Assuming Jewel's reservation price from Question 1b, what is the Zone of Possible Agreement?
- **h.** A decision maker is risk averse if he or she always prefers the EMV of an uncertain event to the uncertain event. For example, a risk-averse decision maker would prefer $50 for sure to a 50-50 chance at $100 or $0, respectively. Moreover, he or she would prefer $100 for sure to a *p* chance at $100 and a *(1-p)* chance at $0. Now suppose that Condor is risk-averse. How would Condor's reservation price change?

- **i.** Two weeks ago, Mary put her house on the market for $215,000. There had been little interest in Mary's house until yesterday, when a young couple saw the house and made an immediate offer of $170,000. Mary told her agent that $170,000 was clearly unacceptable, adding that she was willing to negotiate. How should Mary think about her reservation price for the house?

## Negotiating Traps

Even when people have acquired skills in negotiating, there are still common behaviors that limit effectiveness in ways that trap themselves. Often these traps arise from some specific personal issues that are activated by the negotiating event, such as:

1. Needing to be liked or well thought of by others.
2. Concern with hurting or damaging the other person.
3. Worry that the relationship might be harmed.
4. Fear of conflict.
5. Do any of these preceding issues cause you not to raise negative issues? Do you sugarcoat or understate the position? Do you backpedal at the first sign of resistance?
6. Are there ways you handle either giving or receiving counteroffers that cause problems?
7. Becoming antagonistic or seeing the other as an adversary so that a win-lose situation develops; making blanket accusations about the other's character or motives in the negotiation.
8. Getting locked into one approach; not being flexible; not picking up on what is occurring in the interaction; not being open to new data or behavior to look for ways to break up a deadlock.
9. Losing sight of the other's needs so that when giving alternatives, they are not stated in terms of how the changes are in the other party's best interests.
10. Countering in too general terms; not being specific about the effects and consequences of new terms that might make for a win-win arrangement.
11. Since many interpersonal problems are interpersonally caused, taking on too much of the blame when communications or negotiations break down. If resolved, not being able to recover afterward without giving up too much.
12. Becoming defensive and not owning one's own part of the problem: Being blinded by inability to see limitations or recognize blind spots in your side of the negotiation.
13. Not reaching specific conclusions but allowing generalities to suffice (e.g., "I'll try harder"); not checking that both parties have the same understanding as to what is being agreed to.
14. Failure to follow up and insist on remedies if there is a violation of the agreement.
