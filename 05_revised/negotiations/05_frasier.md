# Frasier (A)

Just one day into his new job at the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Mark Graboff faced a problem: Graboff led the team responsible for renegotiating the rights to *Frasier*, a popular television show critical to NBC's fall 2001 programming lineup. While Paramount, the show's owner, was reportedly demanding $8 million per episode in the press, NBC calculated it could only pay under $5 million per episode to profit from the show. With 24 episodes per season and a three-year term insisted upon by Paramount, the gap seemed insurmountable. To make matters worse, the most likely other bidder for the show was the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), a rival network and Graboff’s former employer. “On November 13 [2000], my last day at CBS, I was finalizing the contract extension for *Everybody Loves Raymond*,” recalled Graboff. “I was thinking, ‘Thank goodness this deal is almost done.’ The next day, I began at NBC, facing an equally arduous negotiation.” Graboff watched the sun set over the Los Angeles skyline as he reviewed the background documents on the negotiation.

## Industry Background

Behind the glitz, glamour, stars, and scandals, Hollywood is, at its core, a business. Studios such as Warner Brothers Television, Paramount Television Group, and Twentieth Century Fox Television produce television shows and license them to networks like NBC, CBS, and the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) for a specified period. Networks generate revenue by selling airtime for advertisements. The higher a show’s ratings, the more networks can charge for commercials. A single ratings point equals 1,022,000 households, or 1% of the nation’s estimated 102.2 million TV homes. During quarterly ratings periods known as “sweeps,” networks use stunts and specials to boost ratings.

License fees paid by networks cover only about 70% of a studio’s production costs. Studios must wait approximately four years to produce enough episodes to sell reruns into syndication. Hit shows like *Seinfeld*, *Mad About You*, and *The Simpsons* can generate hundreds of millions in profits through syndication. However, only about one in ten shows remains on air long enough and is popular enough to enter syndication. Most shows are canceled in their first or second seasons.

Historically, the standard television business model involved a studio licensing a show to a network for an initial period, typically four years. At the end of that period, if the network wanted to keep the show, it had an exclusive 30-day negotiation period, usually in February, to extend the license. If no deal was reached, the studio would submit a final offer. If the network rejected it, the studio could offer the show to other networks, but only on terms equal to or more favorable to the studio than the final offer. If the terms were less favorable, the incumbent network could match them. Renewal contracts typically lasted one or two years, often with options for additional years depending on the show’s ratings.

The 1990s brought dramatic changes to this model. In April 1993, the Federal Communications Commission phased out rules preventing networks from distributing their own programs. Networks began producing shows in-house and securing ownership stakes in shows from outside studios. By 2000, networks owned part or all of most shows on their schedules. Meanwhile, studios moved downstream by creating their own networks. Bob Daly, former chairman of Warner Brothers, teamed up with Fox president Jamie Kellner and other Fox alumni to launch the WB network. Paramount Studios, in partnership with United Television, created the United Paramount Network (UPN).

The entertainment and media industries saw massive consolidation. In 1999, Viacom, owner of Paramount Communications, MTV, Nickelodeon, and Blockbuster Entertainment, acquired CBS for approximately $36 billion—the largest media deal ever. Viacom could now produce shows through its Paramount Television Group and air them on CBS. NBC remained the only major network without a movie business partner. In 1999, NBC held discussions with USA Networks, Time Warner, and Sony about potential partnerships, but these fell apart over issues like price and control.

## Frasier’s Early Years: 1993–1998

*Frasier* is the fifth-most honored show in television history. The only series to win five consecutive Emmys for best comedy, it is just a few statuettes shy of the 29 Emmys amassed by *The Mary Tyler Moore Show*. A spinoff of NBC’s legendary *Cheers*, *Frasier* premiered in September 1993. Its title character, the pompous yet perpetually insecure psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane, divorced his wife, moved from Boston to his hometown of Seattle, and began anew as the host of a radio advice show. Airing immediately after the hit show *Seinfeld*, *Frasier*’s initial time slot was Thursdays at 9:30 p.m. on NBC, one of the best scheduling slots in prime-time television. Advertising executive Steve Sternberg quipped, “You could read the phone book after *Seinfeld* and get a 25 [percent viewer] share.” *Seinfeld* was the latest anchor in NBC’s powerhouse Thursday night lineup, which began in 1984 with *Cheers*, *Night Court*, and *Hill Street Blues*, securing a 15-year run of Thursday night dominance. Jeff Zucker, president of NBC Entertainment, proclaimed, “Thursday is the number one priority of this network.”

Networks paid a substantial premium to advertise on NBC’s Thursday night lineup, targeting the crucial 18-to-49 demographic for weekend releases. Thursday generated 38% of NBC’s overall revenues. Hit shows like *Seinfeld* and *ER* commanded $500,000 or more for a 30-second commercial, boosting rates for adjacent series, late-night newscasts, and *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno*. Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Television, declared, “The economic value of a hit on Thursday is three times as much as a hit on Wednesday and maybe five times as much as a hit on Friday.”

To spread Thursday’s success, NBC occasionally moved hit shows to other nights to strengthen those lineups while keeping Thursday fresh. In the mid-1990s, *Mad About You* and *Hope & Gloria* were transferred to Tuesdays to challenge ABC’s dominance. *Frasier*, in its second season, was switched to Tuesdays at 8:00 p.m. The producers and cast were upset, viewing the move as a demotion from the coveted Thursday slot. Despite the change, which could have confused viewers, *Frasier* thrived on Tuesdays, jump-starting NBC’s Tuesday night lineup and tying or beating ABC’s *Home Improvement*, a show that had previously outperformed a young *Seinfeld*.

In 1996, NBC, the “Peacock Network,” was nearly seven times as profitable as ABC, the only other network to make money that year. However, NBC’s success was precarious. In 1997, *Seinfeld*, “the show about nothing,” contributed about 40% to the network’s $500 million in profits. When *Seinfeld* announced its end in December 1997, NBC began shuffling its shows, fearing vulnerability on Thursdays for the first time since 1984.

## In Seinfeld’s Shadow: 1998–1999

For the 1998–1999 season, NBC moved *Frasier* back to Thursday at 9:00 p.m., replacing *Seinfeld*. This slot was a homecoming for *Frasier*’s star, Kelsey Grammer, who had originated the role of Dr. Crane in that time slot on *Cheers*. NBC hoped *Frasier* would replace *Seinfeld*, as both shows appealed to male viewers. *Frasier* had performed well on Tuesdays, with its 1997–1998 season finale earning the week’s highest ratings in 14.4 million homes, leading the 18-to-49 demographic coveted by advertisers. NBC quietly negotiated an extension for up to three more seasons, paying close to $5 million per episode in the eighth season.

The 1998–1999 season was challenging for NBC. Nearly all its freshman series failed, and many former hits showed their age. On Mondays, *Caroline in the City* and *Suddenly Susan* had dismal ratings; on Tuesdays, *Mad About You* was no longer a hit; on Wednesdays, *3rd Rock from the Sun* was languishing. On Thursdays, TV analyst Marc Berman commented, “*Frasier* is no *Seinfeld*.” By December, *Frasier*’s ratings were down 26% from *Seinfeld*’s the previous year, partly due to a depressing plot twist in which Dr. Crane was unemployed and morose. NBC dropped to second place behind CBS in its first post-*Seinfeld* sweeps. In response, 38-year-old Scott Sassa replaced Warren Littlefield as NBC Entertainment President.

Sassa proposed moving *Frasier* back to Tuesdays, but Paramount vetoed the idea, citing a contract term stipulating the Thursday slot. This highlighted growing tensions between NBC and *Frasier*’s producers and cast. For example, after NBC promoted *Friends* as “the #1 comedy on television,” the *Frasier* team was embittered when NBC didn’t do the same when *Frasier* topped the ratings. The cast also felt short-changed when *Friends* received leather-bound script copies while NBC gave the *Will & Grace* cast $40,000 Porsche automobiles. By mid-season, *Frasier*’s ratings rose 25% from the previous year, and NBC won the February 1999 sweeps, but *Frasier* remained in *Seinfeld*’s shadow. Grammer told the press, “This ratings flak is such that we’re treated like we’re in the bottom ten.” Executive producer Christopher Lloyd echoed, “They really wanted us to be *Seinfeld*. The NBC people thought we’d do *Seinfeld* numbers or better. Talk about pressure. How can you win all those Emmys and be one of the top one or two comedies on TV and have the feeling you’re a failure?”

Thursdays on NBC were no longer what they once were. Viewership dropped 16% from the previous season, and even *ER*, the network’s flagship drama, lost over 15% of its audience. In May 1999, five of the top eight shows in a given week were from NBC’s Thursday lineup, but it was a bittersweet victory: it was the lowest-rated Thursday evening of first-run shows since 1994.

## Bouncing Back: 1999–2000

NBC entered the 1999–2000 season with Garth Ancier as chief programming executive from the WB. The season premieres of *Friends* and *Frasier* ranked #1 and #2, respectively, and *ER*’s return won the 18-to-49 demographic. Momentum slowed, but in late December, *Frasier* had its highest-rated episode in five years, and NBC claimed the top spot among adults 18-to-49. ABC’s *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire* posed a threat, often drawing nearly 30 million viewers three times a week and holding a nine-week winning streak in the 18-to-49 demographic. Yet by spring, *Frasier* performed well against *Millionaire*, often winning its time slot. The season finale, featuring the much-awaited romance between Niles and Daphne, drew 33.7 million viewers—the best ever for *Frasier* and the largest audience on any night since the *Seinfeld* finale.

In spring 2000, during the show’s seventh season, Paramount offered to extend the *Frasier* contract for an increase over the approximately $5 million per episode NBC was paying. Although time remained on the existing contract, Paramount believed NBC might be interested in locking in the show given its rising ratings. NBC, however, was cautious about a fee increase, fearing *Frasier*’s audience might shrink, as had happened with *Mad About You* two years earlier. After all, *Frasier* was seven years old, and despite ranking as the seventh-most popular show, many viewed it as declining. NBC declined Paramount’s offer and moved *Frasier* to Tuesday at 9:00 p.m. While executives knew the change could hasten *Frasier*’s decline, they reasoned the show likely had only one or two years left. If ratings dropped, NBC could renegotiate at a lower price. NBC had renewed *Mad About You* for approximately $3.0 million per episode, only to regret the deal when its final season earned low ratings.

*Frasier*’s co-creator and executive producer Peter Casey reflected, “I wasn’t happy about the move. We thought we did a pretty good job in that Thursday slot.” Even if *Frasier* won its Tuesday slot, ratings were almost certain to drop because NBC was weaker on Tuesdays. Grammer sighed, “Yeah, it certainly looked like somebody was trying to kill us.” Into *Frasier*’s former Thursday slot moved *Will & Grace*. In its third season, this show was supposedly hitting its creative peak. Drawing a younger audience, NBC hoped *Will & Grace* would compete better against *Millionaire*’s older-skewing audience. However, *Will & Grace* averaged 11.8 million viewers in its second season—nearly 10 million fewer than *Frasier*—and ranked only 15th out of 180 series on the six major broadcast networks. Complicating matters, Paramount owned *Frasier*, while *Will & Grace* was produced and owned by NBC’s in-house production company.

Surprisingly, *Frasier* thrived on Tuesdays, becoming the embodiment of “appointment viewing,” drawing viewers at a specific hour regardless of surrounding programs. In its first two broadcasts of the season, it averaged 25.3 million viewers—more than double the audience for *3rd Rock from the Sun* in the preceding half-hour and 40% higher than programs following it. Grammer gloated, “As it turns out, you can strand us in the desert of whatever night you wanted to, and at least some people, the people who think our show is worth a look, would be there. They’ve proven that to us, and I’m grateful to them.” By March 2000, *Frasier* averaged 17 million viewers weekly, down from its Thursday performance but 4.5 million more than its nearest time-slot rival, ABC’s *Dharma & Greg*. *Frasier* ranked a solid 15th in Nielsen Media Research’s season-to-date ratings, second only to *Millionaire* on Tuesday nights.

Despite the success, many on *Frasier* felt betrayed by NBC for moving it to a less popular night. David Hyde Pierce, who played Frasier’s brother Niles, remarked, “My big disappointment in the move to Tuesday night was that, in the seventh or eighth season, most shows do start to drop off in quality, the audience starts to drop off in interest, and that could easily have happened to us. It didn’t, and how nice it would have been for the network to believe in the show enough [to leave it on Thursday nights].”

## The 2001 Negotiations

Mark Graboff entered this situation. A lawyer by training, he spent 15 years practicing entertainment law at a large Los Angeles firm. In 1997, he moved to the business side as the #2 person in CBS’s Business Affairs department, becoming #1 in August 1998. In 1999, he gained industry attention for his role in bringing *Survivor* to CBS. Described by the *New York Post* as the “Survivor Swami,” Graboff explained:

> I met with the creative executives, who said, “How can we figure out a way to pay for this show?” Networks typically don’t have budgets for original programming in the summer; there are not many viewers, and there’s not much ad revenue available. So I worked with the CBS sales department and the production people, and we came up with a business model that made sense for *Survivor* on CBS in the summer. I helped create the business structure, the economic model that we used to create the joint venture that owned the show.

With *Survivor*, Graboff caught the attention of major networks. In October 2000, Scott Sassa offered him the role of Executive Vice President, NBC West Coast, overseeing NBC Network, NBC Studios, NBC Enterprises, and the legal department. Graboff began work at NBC’s Burbank headquarters on November 14, reporting to Sassa. As he settled in, Sassa called: “I’m going to send over the *Frasier* file. Get up to speed on it. Let’s figure out a negotiating strategy.”

Graboff understood the critical importance of the *Frasier* negotiations. As viewers shifted to cable and upstart broadcast networks like Fox, the WB, and UPN, the “Big Three” networks (ABC, NBC, CBS) struggled to establish shows with large audiences. In 1992, 60% of viewers watched the Big Three during prime time; by 1997, only 49% did. Paradoxically, as networks lost viewers, advertisers paid more for shows reaching large audiences. No new NBC series that season, including *The Michael Richards Show*, succeeded, and with *Friends* set to end the next season, analysts speculated that losing *Frasier* could end NBC’s prime-time leadership. Graboff assessed, “Without *Frasier*, our Tuesday night was kind of a wasteland. That year we already had a wasteland on Monday night, Sunday night, and Saturday night. There are only so many nights you can be out of business.” Steve Sternberg, a senior partner at an ad-buying firm, stated, “I’d be very surprised if they let it go. Especially with the lack of new programming success, NBC wants to do everything it can to hang on to *Frasier*.”

However, the negotiations differed from past ones. When NBC last renewed *Frasier* with Viacom-owned Paramount in 1998, Viacom had not yet acquired CBS. The 1999 acquisition transformed the landscape. If NBC failed to reach a deal in 2001, Viacom could place *Frasier* on CBS, an option unavailable in 1998. Had Paramount been affiliated with a network then, NBC might have included a “self-dealing” clause preventing Paramount from airing the show on its own network for a year after leaving NBC. Without such a clause, Paramount could move *Frasier* to CBS immediately if no deal was reached.

Switching networks typically reduces a show’s ratings due to viewer confusion, shortening its life and hurting the studio. No studio had ever moved a show to its sister network, possibly fearing network retaliation or boycotts of future programs. In 1999, Disney combined its television production unit with ABC to ensure more Disney shows aired on the network. An industry source noted, “You need compatible programming from competitive studios to keep your schedule afloat. Paramount is not going to be able to supply all the programs to CBS.”

## Preparation

After reviewing past *Frasier* negotiations, Graboff had the sales, research, and scheduling departments analyze the show’s projected ratings and commercial sales. He recalled:

> I said, “Let’s play the scenario out. Based on our research and sales—what do we think the show is going to do?” Let’s assume the show is on Tuesdays at 9:00, but let’s also analyze it on Thursdays, just so we have that. What would our break-even license fee be? We did that analysis, and we figured out that the current license fee [approximately $5.0 million] was significantly higher than our break-even license fee. So to keep this show at either break-even or a slight loss, we’d have to lower the license fee for the next three years. And here we’ve got numbers like $8 million per episode floated in the press. When I looked at the analysis and how much we were going to lose even if we kept the license fee stable, my first question was, why are we in this negotiation at all?

In November and December 2000, Graboff analyzed alternatives if NBC lost *Frasier*. Replacing it required another comedy with a comparable audience. Some articles suggested that if NBC lost *Frasier*, 20th Century Fox TV, which produced ABC’s *Dharma & Greg*, might stall its February 2001 negotiations, hoping for a higher bid from NBC. With high-rated comedies scarce, NBC might be forced to bid for another network’s show, potentially triggering a bidding war. Graboff and Sassa speculated this could drastically increase programming costs.

In January 2001, Jeff Zucker joined as president of NBC Entertainment, agreeing NBC could take a loss on *Frasier* to avoid a bidding war or losing a show it had promoted for eight years. *Frasier* was a “tent pole,” drawing audiences to launch new shows at 9:30 p.m., especially its upscale viewers who generated high-premium ad dollars. Graboff explained, “Sometimes you’re prepared to take a small loss. Sometimes you’re prepared to break even. Sometimes you won’t do a deal unless you’re going to make money. We steeled ourselves to paying a license fee above our break-even, more than what we were then paying. We said, we’re prepared to lose more money than normal on this show; now let’s try to limit that loss.”

Graboff assessed Paramount’s walk-away alternatives. Only the Big Three networks could afford a megahit like *Frasier*. Fox, UPN, and the WB lacked the viewership. Graboff felt ABC was not a contender: “NBC is the kind of place where the market is set for premium-type shows. We knew ABC wasn’t a player at the price we were talking about, though Paramount kept promising us ABC was very interested.” This left CBS. Having spent four years at CBS, Graboff believed it was not a meaningful competitor: “I knew the license fee we were paying was in excess of what CBS could make in net ad revenue. I estimated CBS’s break-even license fee would be about $3 million.” However, CBS and Paramount’s shared parent, Viacom, complicated the analysis. Graboff noted:

> Usually, you look at the economics of a show from an ad revenue and cost standpoint and say, “OK, my counterpart at ABC is looking at the same thing. Fox is looking at the same thing. CBS is looking at the same thing. We all know what each other’s ad revenues pretty much are, and you can say that a certain show at a certain price is not good business for anybody. It’s a level playing field. For example, in negotiations with Universal for *Just Shoot Me*, that was a level playing field, because Universal had no affiliated network. But in *Frasier*, we weren’t dealing with a level playing field. Forget about what CBS pays Paramount for the license fee because that’s just internal dollars. The real question is, what does the outside world, in the form of ad revenue, pay to Viacom? I knew our numbers on the table were going to be more than that. So I knew the only way it goes to CBS is if [CBS CEO] Les Moonves convinces [Viacom COO] Mel Karmazin that putting *Frasier* on CBS is a triple whammy. It gets it off NBC. It gets it on CBS, where it becomes a tent pole. And third, I knew there was a struggle between certain levels of CBS and Paramount, and getting *Frasier* on CBS would help CBS’s political cause. That was a power factor nonetheless.

Although the exclusivity agreement between NBC and Paramount prohibited contact with CBS, CBS executives dropped hints. Moonves stated, “If a show became available, we’d always listen. It might be an offer we couldn’t refuse.” In early December, a *Los Angeles Times* article quoted a Paramount executive: “[NBC] didn’t believe in the long-term viability of the show. We will make a great effort to keep the show where it is. But if we have to, we think the viewers will travel with it. They followed us back to Tuesdays, and it’s not too much to expect they would follow the show to another network.” The press spotted Grammer dining with Moonves and CBS entertainment chief Nancy Tellem. While reportedly about new shows from Grammer’s production company, Gramnet Productions, some stories suggested plans to subvert NBC were discussed. Graboff reflected:

> The press was trying to hype up the tenseness and the fight between Paramount and NBC and the whole CBS angle. I just thought it was a great story. Frankly, they fueled the fire more than it needed to be. We were trying to keep a low profile. But if necessary, if we reached an impasse, we were going to use the press in our favor. We were going to make sure we got out there publicly all the bad things about the show, how it slid in the ratings, how shows don’t change networks successfully, and all sorts of stuff that would make it unappealing for somebody else to buy it. After all, having worked at CBS, I was in a better position than anybody else to evaluate the chances of the show switching hands. And ultimately, it came down to whether we were prepared to play poker and risk the show going to CBS for non-financial reasons.

## Negotiating the Process

On January 23, 2001, NBC sent a letter to Paramount outlining the negotiation process (see Exhibit 1). An exclusive negotiating period would run from February 1 to March 1. While standard in the industry, Graboff and his Paramount counterpart wanted clear ground rules.

Paramount took the length of the license agreement off the table. Kelsey Grammer insisted on a three-year pickup. While three years was a long extension for an older show, Grammer had additional motivations. Three more seasons would give *Frasier* an 11-year run, matching *Cheers*. Grammer said, “I always thought, the day we started the show, it should be the same run as *Cheers*.” Additionally, he wanted to tie the record for the longest-running primetime television character, held by *Gunsmoke*’s James Arness, who played Matt Dillon for 20 seasons. With nine seasons on *Cheers* and 11 on *Frasier*, Grammer would achieve this.

NBC preferred a shorter pickup. Graboff recalled:

> Our big concern was that the show was starting to show signs of age. We felt it had one year, maybe two, left after the eighth season, but the third year could be disastrous. We didn’t want to commit to the third year. If we were going to lose money in years one and two, we were going to get our projection. We made proposals with a three-year pickup but a cutback right that said if ratings fell below a certain number in our 18-to-49 demographic in the second year—which was kind of a disaster-scenario number—we didn’t have to pick up the third year. Our argument was, by that time, everybody’s embarrassed. And their attitude was, “That’s a non-starter. Kelsey will be insulted. You don’t want to do this.” So Scott [Sassa] went and talked to Kelsey and asked him squarely, “Is three years really that important to you?” And basically Kelsey said, “Look, at the end of the day, you’re not going to be embarrassed.” So that gave us the comfort we needed to take this issue off the table.

The parties were ready to negotiate in earnest.

## Negotiating Price

As stipulated in the January 23 letter, negotiations began on February 1, 2001. Graboff led for NBC, consulting regularly with Sassa and Zucker, occasionally involving CEO Bob Wright. They worked with sales, research, and scheduling departments to analyze scenarios. Paramount’s team was led by Chairman Kerry McCluggage, often joined by Gary Hart, president of Paramount Network TV.

Graboff noted the negotiations focused “purely on price, and some ancillary things which were, if you boil it down, price-related.” A significant gap existed. Press rumors suggested Paramount wanted $8.0 million per episode—a large increase over the current deal. Analysts doubted NBC would pay more than $5.8 million, the price for *Friends*, its highest-rated sitcom. While Paramount didn’t raise the $8.0 million figure in negotiations, the parties’ initial offers were far apart. Graboff said:

> Paramount’s initial offer was about a 20% increase over what we were currently paying, while our initial number was about 5% less than what we were paying. In other words, our initial number was about a million and a quarter dollars less per episode than theirs. Usually when you’re negotiating licenses, you’re tens of thousands of dollars apart, not millions.

Negotiations occurred over the phone, with occasional summits between McCluggage and Sassa or Wright. As the March 1 deadline approached, NBC proposed creative solutions: ratings-based bonuses for every tenth of a ratings point above a threshold, up to a cap, and development commitments for Paramount (including Grammer’s 34th Street Productions). Graboff explained, “Development commitments boil down to money, but it came out of a different pool of money for us, so in some ways it was easier to give.”

Even after these efforts, a $500,000 per episode gap remained. Paramount reduced their offer by about $500,000 per episode but then held firm, warning other networks were interested and the show might go elsewhere. Graboff recalled:

> They wouldn’t budge, telling us that other networks were interested, and it was going to go to another network if we didn’t come up with this price. It all became a question of, do we want to call their bluff? Do we want to allow this to go to the marketplace and see whether they’re telling the truth or not? That was really what we were faced with. There were several meetings where we looked at each other across the table and were at a standoff. We walked away from the table a couple of times when they brought up points they claimed were on the table that had never been on the table. We just got really angry and we walked away. We threatened them a bunch of times, and they threatened us as well. For a while, it really got ugly.

Graboff speculated the $8 million figure came from outside observers, not Paramount: “There were some gadflies who had financial interests in the show. A couple of the agents, who represent some of the producers and talent, had a strong interest to get the price as high as possible. So that’s how the $8 million got leaked.”

## The End Game

March 1, the deadline for the exclusive negotiating period, was a Thursday. Throughout the day, Graboff did not contact Paramount, nor did they call him. At 8:00 p.m., Graboff left for home. He recalled:

> I was in my car, and I got a call. It was the Paramount guys. They said, “What are you doing in your car? We want to work through the night to get this done.” And I said, “No, we’re not going to get this done tonight. Scott [Sassa] went home, Jeff [Zucker] went home, and I’m going home. You guys can stay up all night if you want. Knock yourselves out.”

Hanging up, Graboff swallowed hard. He knew that by not returning to the table, he risked Paramount presenting a Last Offer, allowing them to take *Frasier* to CBS and potentially sparking a bidding war. Yet, he was confident in his analysis of Paramount’s position, CBS’s economics, and the dynamics within Viacom. This was his first major negotiation at NBC, and upcoming negotiations for *The West Wing* and *Just Shoot Me* loomed. He needed to start on the right foot.

## Exhibit 1: Letter Defining the Terms of the Negotiations

**January 23, 2001**

**Re: “FRASIER” Renewal Negotiations**

Dear [Paramount executive]:

This will confirm that our exclusive negotiation period will commence February 1, 2001. To confirm we are both on the same page with respect to the negotiations for the renewal of *Frasier*, I am sending you this summary of the terms.

1. The first negotiation period lasts from February 1, 2001, to March 1, 2001. Both NBC and [Paramount] acknowledge that this negotiation was not affected by any previous exploratory discussions (as confirmed in my fully-executed letter to you dated November 29, 2000).
2. If no agreement is reached by March 1, 2001, Paramount will submit its last offer (“Last Offer”) to NBC. If NBC rejects said Last Offer, Paramount is free to negotiate with third parties, subject to the matching rights of NBC set forth below.
3. If Paramount wants to license the series to a third party (including, without limitation, CBS) on financial terms less favorable to Paramount than the Last Offer, NBC has 10 days to match the offer. Paramount may license the series to a third party (including, without limitation, CBS) on financial terms equal to or more favorable than the Last Offer, without any further obligation to NBC.
4. If NBC’s right to match an offer comes into play, NBC must match the aggregate, total financial value of the third-party offer within 10 days of NBC’s receipt of notice of the third-party offer. Such financial value includes, without limitation, terms such as the term of the license fee, the number of episodes ordered, and any sharing of revenue streams.
5. NBC’s matching right continues until March 1, 2002.

The above reflects our understanding of the agreement, and we are proceeding in reliance thereon.

Very truly yours,

[NBC executive]
