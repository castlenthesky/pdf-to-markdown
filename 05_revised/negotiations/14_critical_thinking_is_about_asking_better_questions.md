# Critical Thinking Is About Asking Better Questions

Six practices to sharpen your inquiry.

Are you tackling a new and difficult problem at work? Recently promoted and trying to both understand your new role and bring a fresh perspective? Or are you new to the workforce and seeking ways to meaningfully contribute alongside your more experienced colleagues? If so, critical thinking—the ability to analyze and effectively break down problems—will be core to your success. And at the heart of critical thinking is the ability to formulate different and effective questions.

Consider this: Clayton M. Christensen was perhaps the greatest management thinker of the last 30 years. His "How Will You Measure Your Life" is a Harvard Business Review bestseller and one of the five best articles on personal development I've read, and his theories on innovation and disruption changed business. But my most memorable encounter with Christensen was a talk at Harvard Business School where he discussed his own approach to his time as an MBA student decades before.

He said HBS was where he learned to ask great questions. Impressed with his classmates, he would carry a notebook to class and write down the most insightful questions other students asked. He'd then go home and reflect on how and why the students had formulated them. Ever curious, Christensen laid the foundation for his future insights by first studying the process by which people formulated their best queries.

You can approach curiosity just as rigorously and use that process to get a better view of a new situation or solve some of your toughest problems. Here are a few ways to enhance your ability to interrogate even the most difficult topics:

## Hold your hypotheses loosely.

As a former analyst at McKinsey & Company, one of the first things I learned was hypothesis-driven thinking. Based on the scientific method, this process is what allows McKinsey teams to work through problems quickly and efficiently. It involves formulating an early answer to a problem and then digging into the data to seek to improve and refine it. Core to this approach, however, is holding your hypothesis loosely. If you are too attached to your initial answer, you may refuse to let it go, no matter where the data leads. But if you treat your own answer as a strawman, holding your assumptions loosely, you'll be willing to totally abandon it if the situation calls for it.

Suppose for simplicity that Gloria's book will sell either 50,000 (moderate seller) or 100,000 (best seller) copies. Franklin believes that the probability of 50,000 copies is 0.70, whereas the probability of Gloria's book becoming a best seller is 0.30. Gloria, of course, disagrees: she believes that it is more likely to be a best seller than a moderate seller. She assesses the probabilities of sales of 50,000 and 100,000 copies as 0.20 and 0.80, respectively.

To illustrate a contingent deal, suppose that Gloria needs a flat advance of $140,000 for her novel, or else she will shop her book elsewhere. The most Franklin can offer is $120,000. Since Gloria wants $140,000, and the highest Franklin is prepared to offer is $120,000, there is no possibility of an agreement involving unconditional payments. There is, however, a deal involving conditional payments. If Gloria's book sells 100,000 copies, Franklin's payment to Gloria is $160,000. The expected value to Franklin is now (0.70)($100,000) + (0.30)($160,000) = $118,000, better than Franklin's maximum. For Gloria, the expected value of the new arrangement is (0.20)($100,000) + (0.80)($160,000) = $148,000, which exceeds her minimum. There's a deal!

|                              | 50,000 Copies Sold | 100,000 Copies Sold | Expected Value |
|------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Franklin's payment to Gloria | $100,000           | $160,000            |                |
| Cost to Franklin            |                    |                     | $118,000       |
| Benefit to Gloria           |                    |                     | $148,000       |

What has happened? Returning to Principle 2, we see that Franklin and Gloria each have exchanged something expected to be cheap to one for something the other expects to be valuable. Since Franklin believes that the chance of 100,000 copies is only 0.30, it is not terribly costly for him to offer Gloria a higher sum in that event. In return, Franklin pays less, $100,000, if the book only sells 50,000 copies, an event that Franklin believes is likely. Gloria, on the other hand, is quite willing to take a lower minimum payment, $100,000, because she believes that there is a 0.80 chance that she will actually receive an additional $60,000. In other words, each has exchanged something cheap to her in expected value terms for something she judges to be valuable in expected value terms. Once again, we have an application of Principle 2.

Franklin and Gloria can both do even better by lowering Franklin's payment to Gloria in the event that Gloria's book sells 50,000 copies and increasing Franklin's payment to Gloria in the event that Gloria's book is a best seller. The following payment structure has a higher expected value for both Franklin and Gloria.

|                              | 50,000 Copies Sold | 100,000 Copies Sold | Expected Value |
|------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Franklin's payment to Gloria | $50,000            | $200,000            |                |
| Cost to Franklin            |                    |                     | $95,000        |
| Benefit to Gloria           |                    |                     | $170,000       |

In fact, mathematically, there are no limits to the expected value joint gains that can be created. In the following example, Gloria pays Franklin $5,000,000 in the event that her book sells 50,000 copies, but receives $5,000,000 if her book becomes a best seller. Both Franklin and Gloria make money in expected value terms when the deal is structured in this fashion!

Questions encourage critical thinking in a group, offer an individual to expand on their viewpoints, and leave people the space to actively problem-solve.

## Consider the counterintuitive.

When problem-solving, we often quickly fall into groupthink: The group converges on a path too rapidly, and rather than periodically assuring they are headed in the right direction, they continue further and further even if it's the wrong way. Be the person who poses the counterintuitive question, the one that challenges the group's conventional thinking and reconsiders first principles. There's a chance your question may be off-base and that the group is on the right track. And, yes, there's a chance your colleagues who are interested in moving quickly will be annoyed. But every group has an obligation to consider the counterintuitive and needs someone unafraid to pose it, in case they need to change course.

## Stew in a problem.

In today's rapid-fire world, we try to make decisions too quickly. But the best questions are often formulated after consideration and a night's rest. Sleep can actually help your brain assimilate a problem and see it more clearly. And a deliberate process often leads to better conclusions. Research also shows that when we rush decisions, we often regret them even if they end up being correct.

What I love about Christensen's approach to learning from his classmates' questions is that rather than diagnosing them in the moment, he'd take them home and carefully turn them over in his mind. I had a boss who referred to this as "stewing" in a problem. Just as a stew takes time to simmer, a thoughtful conclusion or question may need space. Resist unnecessary urgency. Map a process that will allow you to solve a problem over several days or longer. Dig into it initially, then reflect on what you learned and what you should have asked. The questions you formulate in quiet reflection may be more powerful than those posed in the moment.

## Ask the hard follow-up questions.

It can be easy to put our brains on cruise control, to accept easy answers, or to yield to social pressures that push us to avoid interrogating others. But the kinds of deep questions that enable critical thinking are often delivered in chains of deeper and deeper follow-up inquiry. Every parent is familiar with the way children (nature's most curious people) will ask "why" dozens of times when given an answer. And we parents often find ourselves stuck or reconsidering our own answers at the end of this train of questioning.

While we don't need to ask a litany of "whys" to get to the heart of critical thinking, we should ask thoughtful, even hard, follow-up questions. It requires energy to listen hard and formulate those follow-ups, and that's often the only way to deepen your critical understanding of a topic.

Critical thinking is at the heart of solving complex problems in new and exciting ways. Building this skill will help you as you navigate new roles, establish yourself in your organization, or simply face a conundrum. Learn to formulate and ask questions, rather than simply answering them.
