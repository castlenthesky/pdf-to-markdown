# Netflix: Pioneering the Future of Home Video

In late January 2007, Reed Hastings, the founder and CEO of Netflix, concluded a meeting with his senior management team at the company's headquarters in Los Gatos, California. Netflix, a pioneer in online DVD rentals, was preparing to unveil its highly anticipated entry into the online video market. Industry observers believed that the ability of customers to order movies through their computers for instant viewing—commonly referred to as video-on-demand (VOD)—would significantly impact Netflix’s core DVD rental business. Hastings, reflecting on years of investment and discussions surrounding this new feature, considered the merits of alternative paths not taken. As his team left the boardroom, he returned to his desk with resolve to review his forthcoming announcement one final time, knowing it would shape not only the market’s perception of Netflix but also its ability to maintain its leadership in the home video industry.

## Company Background

Netflix, an online subscription-based DVD rental service, was conceived by Hastings after he discovered an overdue rental copy of *Apollo 13* in his closet. After paying a $40 late fee, Hastings, a software entrepreneur, began exploring alternative ways to provide a home movie service that would better satisfy customers. The business that emerged used the U.S. Postal Service to deliver DVDs to subscribers. By year-end 2006, subscribers could choose from over 70,000 titles held on more than 55 million DVDs through Netflix’s website. With 44 distribution centers across the country, Netflix could deliver to over 90% of its 6.6 million subscribers within a single business day. The service offered unlimited monthly rentals for a flat fee of $17.99, allowing customers to hold up to three movies at a time.

## The History of Home Video Rental

When Netflix was founded in 1997, the home video market was fragmented, dominated by “mom-and-pop” retail outlets. Customers rented movies, primarily on VHS cassettes, from retail locations for a specified period, typically two days to one week, at a cost of $3 to $4 per movie. The market leader, Blockbuster Inc., built its success on the insight that movie rentals were often impulse decisions. For customers deciding at the last minute that a given night was “movie night,” the ability to quickly obtain the newest release was a priority. Statistics showed that new releases accounted for over 70% of total rentals.

Blockbuster’s growth strategy revolved around opening new locations to expand geographic coverage and increase market share. By 2006, Blockbuster operated 5,194 U.S. locations, of which 4,255 were company-owned, with the remainder franchised. Locations were chosen based on local data, prioritizing high-traffic, highly visible stores. Management often stated that “70% of the U.S. population lives within a 10-minute drive of a Blockbuster,” highlighting its unmatched convenience for impulse renters. Stores were staffed primarily with part-time employees, averaging 10 staff members per store plus one manager. Occupancy and payroll represented significant costs.

Blockbuster stores carried about 2,500 titles, with shelf space dedicated primarily to hit movies and new releases, which received prominent positioning. Stores acquired multiple copies of popular films at approximately $18 per DVD to meet high demand at release. Financial success depended on maximizing the days a movie was rented. Stores were reluctant to stock large numbers of lesser-known or independent films due to inconsistent demand. Blockbuster often sold previewed copies of new releases at a discount to generate incremental revenue and clear shelf space.

Traditionally, movies not returned within the rental period incurred extended viewing fees, or “late fees.” In 2004, these fees were a significant revenue source for Blockbuster. Late fees also ensured timely returns, allowing movies to be rented again and reducing stockouts. Delayed returns could lead to missed rental opportunities and lower customer satisfaction.

In 2002, Blockbuster enjoyed record revenue and profitability amid industry expansion. According to *Investor’s Business Daily* (August 12, 2002), DVD players were in 37% of U.S. television households, up from 24% the previous year. This increase helped grow industry movie rental revenues from $8.5 billion to $8.7 billion. The year 2002 marked Blockbuster’s fifth consecutive year of same-store sales growth, with the brand achieving nearly 100% recognition among active movie renters.

## Netflix History

Founded in 1997 during the rise of Internet retailing, Netflix offered home delivery of DVDs through the mail, bypassing the need for retail locations. When its website launched in early 1998, most video stores rented VHS cassettes, but Netflix focused on early adopters of DVD players. Its marketing strategy included cross-promotional programs with DVD player manufacturers and sellers to provide content for their customers. Hastings noted, “We were targeting people who just bought DVD players. At the time, our goal was to get our coupon in the box. We didn’t have much competition. The market was underserved, and stores didn’t carry a wide selection of DVDs.”

Netflix’s website featured a search engine allowing customers to sort titles by title, actor, director, or genre. Customers built a queue of movies to be received, with Netflix sending the next title upon the return of a rented film. Rather than leasing retail spaces, Netflix relied on the U.S. Postal Service for delivery. Hastings tested the USPS’s reliability by mailing CDs to himself, noting, “I waited for two days, and all arrived in perfect condition. All the pieces started to fall into place after that” (*Financial Times*, October 4, 2005).

Initially, Netflix used a pricing model similar to traditional video stores: $4 per movie plus a $2 shipping and handling fee, with due dates and extended rental fees for late returns. Drawing from successful Internet retailers like eBay and Amazon, Netflix identified value, convenience, and selection as key customer appeals. Early on, Netflix aimed to be the ultimate online destination for movie enthusiasts, offering recommendations to all users and exploring additional services like price comparisons and theater tickets. However, the dot-com crash forced a focus on rentals. Hastings explained, “That summer we realized we weren’t going to make it unless we focused on rentals. It was a cash-induced strategic focusing” (*Financial Times*, October 4, 2005).

The rapid adoption of DVD players—reaching 13% of U.S. households by 2000—intensified competition as retailers like Best Buy and Wal-Mart began selling DVDs. Netflix shelved its IPO plans and faced layoffs while adjusting its business model. Customer feedback revealed dissatisfaction with Netflix’s pricing, which matched retail stores but offered slower delivery. In 1999, Netflix shifted to a no-late-fee subscription model, allowing customers to hold four movies at once and receive up to four new films monthly. This turned delivery time into an advantage by ensuring “a movie at home all the time,” as chief product officer Neil Hunt described. Soon after, Netflix introduced unlimited rentals, allowing subscribers to keep three movies and exchange them as often as desired. Hunt noted, “The term ‘unlimited’ is great marketing. We had vigorous debates, but it was a leap of faith. The ones who got it right would succeed” (*Financial Times*, October 4, 2005).

This pricing change attracted high-volume customers who viewed movie rentals as daily entertainment. These customers, turned off by per-rental fees and late charges, found Netflix’s “all you can eat” model appealing. However, the cost of acquiring movies remained a challenge. Hunt explained, “Half of the DVDs we were shipping were brand new. Those movies were the most expensive to acquire. We needed to stimulate demand for older and less-known movies to drive down the average cost of building our catalog.”

Netflix initially relied on traditional merchandising, with employees highlighting films on the website’s homepage. This approach led to instant rentals of promoted titles, overwhelming inventory. Recognizing this limitation, Netflix developed a proprietary recommendation system. New subscribers completed a survey on favorite genres and rated titles, and the algorithm used these inputs, along with ratings from millions of users, to recommend films. The recommendations page included synopses, reasons for the recommendation, and user reviews. As customers rated more movies, the system refined its suggestions. A filter ensured out-of-stock titles were not recommended, reducing customer frustration and increasing library utilization. By 2006, new releases accounted for less than 30% of Netflix’s rentals, compared to over 70% at traditional stores. Hunt noted, “Ratings are three-fourths of a star higher on recommended movies compared to new releases” (*Financial Times*, October 4, 2005).

This shift sparked a cultural battle within Netflix, as some employees favored traditional merchandising. Hastings emphasized, “A personalized experience is the benefit of the Internet. If you can do it offline, people won’t pay for it online. We had to find something stores couldn’t do well.” Netflix’s large user base and extensive rating system created a network effect, making its recommendations more accurate than competitors’.

Building the movie library remained costly, as Netflix initially relied on distributors with minimal discounts. Customer dissatisfaction with delays in renting new releases prompted the hiring of Ted Sarandos as chief content officer in 2000. Sarandos, formerly of Video City, negotiated revenue-sharing agreements with major studios, reducing upfront costs to about $20 per DVD in exchange for a fee based on rental volume. Hastings noted, “We spent more money, not less, with the studios but got bigger customer satisfaction. It was like paying 20% more and getting two times the number of copies.”

These agreements improved access to high-demand titles and supported Netflix’s focus on lesser-known films, which were underserved by retail stores. Sarandos explained, “The thing Reed and I connected on was the promise of a business model that promoted lesser-known movies. Films outside the top 20 are not distributed widely” (*Financial Times*, October 4, 2005). Using a national inventory, Netflix satisfied diverse demands with fewer copies than retail chains, requiring only one-third to one-fifth of their inventory.

In 2001, Netflix’s single distribution center in Sunnyvale, California, struggled with delivery times outside the San Francisco Bay Area. Testing in Sacramento showed that overnight delivery significantly boosted success. Netflix expanded to 44 distribution centers by early 2007, enabling next-day delivery for over 90% of subscribers. This allowed Netflix to compete on convenience, value, and selection. Each center cost about $60,000 to convert, and manual processes enabled employees to handle 800 DVDs per hour, shipping over 1.6 million DVDs daily (see Exhibit 3).

Netflix strengthened its USPS relationship, using presorting discounts and truck routes to expedite returns, improving turnaround times. Content acquisition grew critical as subscriber numbers increased. Sarandos noted, “Our buying staff has to have their finger on the pulse of the market. A high box-office performer won’t necessarily be a high video performer” (*Financial Times*, October 4, 2005). Netflix became a key distribution channel for independent films, with titles like *Hotel Rwanda* ranking as its fourth-most-rented film despite modest box-office performance.

In 2006, Netflix launched Red Envelope Entertainment to acquire distribution rights for independent films. Sarandos explained, “Of the 100 films featured at Sundance, only 10 make it to DVD. We look through the other 90 for top-tier content to bring to our customers.” This enhanced Netflix’s reputation as a source for independent films.

Customer churn, at 6.3% in 2006, was a key concern. Netflix simplified unsubscribing in 2002, allowing customers to cancel online and complete a brief survey. Hastings noted, “We realized making it hard to cancel was a false savings. We had a 30-day burst of churn, but it led to return visitors.” The recommendation system and queue, averaging 50 movies, were major retention tools. Customer profiles were maintained, encouraging returns.

## Blockbuster Responds

In 2002, Blockbuster dismissed online rentals as a niche market with an unsustainable business model (*Associated Press Newswires*, May 18, 2002; *Investor’s Business Daily*, August 12, 2002). By 2004, Blockbuster launched Blockbuster Online, matching Netflix’s subscription model but undercutting its pricing to regain market share. It leveraged in-store inventory and offered rental coupons to online customers. By 2006, Blockbuster Online had 2.2 million members but faced significant operating losses. Hastings remarked, “We’re thankful Blockbuster didn’t enter four years ago” (*The New York Times*, February 22, 2005).

Blockbuster eliminated late fees in 2005, incurring $60 million in marketing costs and forgoing $600 million in revenue. While traffic increased, base rental revenue grew only 5%.

## Video-on-Demand

Industry observers viewed VOD as the next big thing in home video, combining pay-per-view with Internet downloading. Customers could access a vast library for instant viewing in DVD quality. The rise of high-definition pay-per-view and streaming video suggested VOD’s inevitability.

### Online Video Alternatives

Hastings categorized Internet video into three groups:

1. **Advertising-Supported Video**: Similar to network television, this included user-generated content, TV-style programming, and older films, interrupted by ads. Sites like YouTube and network websites (e.g., ABC.com) operated here, but high content costs limited new-release availability.
2. **Digital File Ownership**: Customers could purchase and download films to a limited number of devices, akin to buying DVDs or music from iTunes, with revenue from sales at DVD retail prices.
3. **Online Video Rental and Pay TV**: Offering temporary downloads for about $3, this segment focused on feature-length films with minimal advertising. Netflix aimed to compete here.

### VOD Competition

By 2007, VOD competitors included:

- **Stand-Alone Services**: Vongo (Starz) and CinemaNow (Lionsgate, Microsoft, Cisco) offered rentals, purchases, or DVD burning for a few thousand titles.
- **Set-Top Box Services**: MovieBeam required a set-top box purchase and per-movie fees for a limited, refreshed selection. It was acquired by Movie Gallery in 2007.
- **Studio Ventures**: Blockbuster planned to acquire MovieLink, a pay-per-view service with 1,500 films from major studios.
- **Cable and Satellite Providers**: These offered on-demand programming, leveraging existing TV access and offering high-definition content without new equipment.

VOD faced two limitations: technology (connecting computers to TVs) and content availability. Studios, concerned about piracy and protecting DVD sales, limited VOD content. Hastings noted, “U.S. laws enable anyone to buy a DVD and rent it as many times as they want. Online content requires negotiating distribution rights” (*Financial Times*, October 4, 2005). Hunt added, “Studios believe the proper price for online content is $20 per viewing, limiting it to older or less popular films.”

## Online Video at Netflix

Most observers saw VOD as a threat to Netflix’s DVD rental model, as it eliminated the need to choose between selection and instant access. Hastings viewed Netflix’s purpose as providing the best home video experience, not just DVD rentals. In 2003, he stated, “Our hope is that we’ll eventually be able to download more movies. It’s why we named the business Netflix” (*Financial Times*, October 4, 2005). Netflix planned VOD services as early as 2001, investing $10 million in 2006 and planning $40 million for 2007. Hastings recognized that resolving connectivity and content limitations was critical, and Netflix needed a functional VOD offering ready when these issues were addressed.

Finding a “beachhead” customer base for VOD proved challenging, as no niche group emerged to drive early demand. Netflix considered three VOD strategies:

1. **Licensing to Cable Providers**: Netflix could license its recommendation system to cable companies, allowing subscribers to use Netflix’s interface for instant TV viewing. This bypassed connectivity issues and piracy concerns but risked partnering with competitors. Hastings questioned the timing, given rapid technological advancements.
2. **Integrating VOD into Core Offering**: Netflix could offer streaming as a free add-on to its DVD rental service, leveraging its brand, recommendation system, and market share. This would differentiate Netflix from stand-alone VOD competitors but risked no additional revenue despite content acquisition costs. Hastings worried this contradicted Netflix’s focus on positive cash flows.
3. **Stand-Alone VOD Business**: A separate VOD service, like Vongo or MovieLink, would avoid distracting the core team but required a new business unit. While the market was small in 2007, Hastings believed resolving content and connectivity issues would lead to growth, with Netflix’s brand providing an advantage.

The announcement was days away, and Hastings faced a critical decision to shape Netflix’s future in the evolving home video market.
