## The a2 Milk Company

"We would like to think we are demonstrating a unique business model and strategy.

Geoffrey Babidge; CEO of The a2 Milk Company (2017) 1

On February 23, 2018, two after The a2 Milk Company (a2MC) announced a new 'strategic relationship" with Fonterra Co-Cooperative Group, it became the most valuable company on the New Zealand Stock Exchange: Over the past its market value had rocketed from NZS2 to NZSIO billion ' (See Exhibit 1.) a2MC was a processing firm with sales of NZS728 million in calendar 2017. It sold both drinking milk and infant formula primarily in China and Australia. What distinguished a2MC from other processing firms was that it sold products containing the A2 " beta-casein protein only, not the Al protein that most cows produced (i.e , its products were Al free, see Exhibit 2) Eliminating the Al protein from products was significant because many people found it difficult to digest the Al protein and research suggested it could be related to health problems such as diabetes and heart disease. days year, dairy year dairy dairy

The new partner, New Zealand-based Fonterra, was the worlds sixth largest processor with sales of NZS19 billion in 2017.2 It was a farmer-owned cooperative that produced and sold products globally, but did not produce any Al-free products: ` According to Fonterra, the partnership would 'fast-track market growth' by combining Fonterra' s sales and distribution expertise with a2MCs brand strength. 3 An industry blogger described the move as a seismic shift for both the New Zealand and global \_ industries' that was driven by the realization that . continuing to "fight against the A2 cause was a stance " 4 Investors responded enthusiastically to the news a2MC's stock up 27% that Several senior executives took this opportunity to sell shares. in particular, sold 1.5 million a2MC shares for NZS19.7 million leaving him with 25 million shares š dairy dairy dairy losing driving Babidge price day .

But one month later, Nestle, the world s largest dairy firm, confirmed it had launched its own Alfree infant   formula in China.

These decision were complicated by the fact he was scheduled to retire in July and would be replaced by Jayne Hrdlicka, an American who had run Jetstar   (a low-cost Australian airline owned by Qantas)  served as a non-executive director  of Woolworths (Australia's largest supermarket chain) , worked at Bain &amp; Company, and graduated from the Tuck Business School.

## Dairy Products and the AA2 Discovery

At a high level, the global beverage industry had two major segments:   alcoholic (e.8- beer, wine, and spirits) and non-alcoholic beverages. The latter could be further divided into beverages that were typically consumed hot such as coffee and tea and those that were typically consumed cold such as water, carbonated soft drinks, fruit juices, sports drinks, and milk. Relative to other beverages, milk were wanted the nutritional benefits calcium vitamin D; and protein) , or liked the taste. they thirsty , (e.8

The primary ingredient in drinking milk was raw cow's milk which could also be used to make a of products butter and cheese). Because raw milk was highly perishable, processors removed the water to make milk powders that had a much longer shelf life and only 10% of the weight. In powder form, it was easier and cheaper to distances approximately one third of Australian products were subsequently exported. 10 One of the major uses for milk powders was infant formula. After the powder could be re-hydrated and used as a substitute for or an alternative to human breast milk. variety dairy dairy (eg ship long dairy

Annual per consumption of drinking milk ranged from a low of 20 liters in China to a high of 135 liters in Ireland: Australia and New Zealand were near the upper end of per capitalconsumption with of just over 100 liters each. (Exhibit 3a shows per consumption; Exhibit 3b shows the size of the global industry and the major segments:) While consumption patterns differed across countries, per capita milk consumption was declining in many countries. In the U.S, for example, it had declined about 1% per year for the past 7Oyears. 11 One reason for the decline was that many people had trouble digesting milk-it caused bloating' gas, and diarrhea. The cause for some people was lactose intolerance: did not produce enough of the chemical needed to digest lactose, the natural sugar found in all mammalian milk.  This condition was more prevalent in older people and less common children ~and in certain ethnic groups: approximately 20% of Caucasian; 70% of African; and 90% of Asian adults had trouble digesting milk.12 But many people who had trouble digesting milk were not technically lactose intolerant by medical standards. Áccording to one survey , 25% of Ämerican adults (85 million people) felt discomfort after consuming products when in fact only 5% were actually lactose intolerant. 13 Among those who felt discomfort; a majority of them did not drink milk. 14 As a result, there was a segment of the world' s population that either did not drink milk or did so with discomfort. capital capital dairy they among dairy large

Besides lactose intolerance; an alternative hypothesis for people had trouble digesting milk had to do with its chemical composition. In the 1960s, biochemists discovered that cows, even from the same breed, naturally produced different kinds of beta casein proteins. 15 Ten thousand ago, why years

all cows produced the A2 protein only , but genetic mutations had caused some cows to produce a variant called Al (see Exhibit 4). All cows had two alleles (ie , two types of genes) and milk production was determined by which alleles the cow possessed. If a cow had the Al allele, its milk contained the Al protein. 70% of cows produced some version of the Al protein (either pure Al/Al or a combination of Al/A2 proteins) . The difference between the Al and A2 proteins involved a single amino acid in a chain of more than 209 amino acids (see Exhibit 5) . In 1993, two New Zealand scientists Bob Elliott and Corran McLachlan discovered that humans digested the Al and A2 proteins differently . A protein fragment called BCM-7, a type of opioid, broke off the digestion of milk containing the Al protein causing inflammation in the digestive system: Scientists suspected the inflammation caused the discomfort many experienced after consuming products and could be related to more serious illnesses ranging from diabetes and autism to heart disease and allergies. Today, during people dairy

Since that time scientists had been trying to prove whether the Al protein did, indeed, cause discomfort and other health problems. 16 Some of the early studies were rejected because were done on animals not humans. Another early study was disputed because it was done by a consultant to Fonterra, a conventional firm Fonterra scientists regularly rejected the health claims made about the Al protein saying were 'irresponsible" and lacked 'compelling evidence. "17 In 2014, a2MC sponsored a test on humans that showed people reported less after consuming Al-free milk. Although it was published in a reputable nutrition journal , people questioned the results because describing Al-free milk as just a 'marketing concept:"18 The following a2MC sponsored another study involving 600 Chinese adults. It, scientific community remained divided prompting the New Zealand government to conclude: they dairy they pain year , too,

The A1/A2 hypothesis is both   intriguing and potentially very   important for population health if it is proved correct:  It should be taken seriously and further research is needed. .As a matter of choice, people may wish to reduce or remove Al ß-casein from their diet. [but] should do so knowing that there is substantial uncertainty about the benefits of such an approach 19 they

Despite the uncertainty, many people drank a2 Milk@ and swore by it:. a2MC ran testimonials on its web site with claims like this one from a woman named Lisa: "I suffer from an upset stomach after drinking regular milk. Now I have none of these symptoms , thanks to a2 Milk@. '20

The demand for products in general combined with the large fraction of the population that had trouble digesting milk had created demand for two new kinds of milk. The first kind was specialty milks" which included A2 cow milk, milk (which contained the A2 protein only) , and lactose-free milk.  This segment accounted for 5% of the milk market and was the fastest growing segment.21 Because   all milk contained   lactose, Al-free milk did not  help people with lactose intolerance, but it did help many people with digestion problems and it tasted like conventional milk In contrast; both lactose-free and goat milk tasted considerably different from regular cow's milk. The second kind of milk was plant-based represented 10% of the milk market: 22 But these plant-based alternatives also tasted considerably different from regular cow's milk. large dairy goat

Health concerns also created demand for organic milk (~5% of the market) . Whereas organic milk required a different kind of process; producing Al-free milk required exactly the same process as conventional milk once vou created a herd of pure A2/A2 cows. The conversion process, however, took time and incremental cost.  Given breeding cycles , herd conversion could take up to 10 years, but the timeline could be reduced to five or so years by pure A2 bull semen for artificial farming A2/ using

insemination; by and removing calves with the Al gene, and by breeding cows at younger ages. 23 While many firms around the world provided A2 bull semen, the suppliers in New Zealand and Australia tested all of their bulls for the A2 gene the genetic test cost NZS23 per animal~ and offered A2 semen at no additional cost. The cost of pure A2 semen was NZS25 per straw (one straw was to fertilize a cow) and a healthy bull could produce enough semen to create tens of thousands of straws per year. 24 testing leading required

## The Australian Dairy Industry

The production and sale of products consisted of three stages: farming, milk processing and retail distribution: With a few minor exceptions, the Australian and New Zealand industries were similar. Because the Australian operations grew increasingly important to a2MC over time and it was a bigger market, this section focuses primarily on the Australian dairy industry. dairy dairy dairy quite

The production process began on one of Australia' s 5,800 farms where 1.5 million cows produced 9 billion liters of milk worth AS3.7 billion: 25 Farming was a difficult business that generated both low and volatile margins:   the average return on capital for Australian farms was 2.2% since 2000 (not counting land appreciation) . Larger farms generated higher returns in part because received higher milk from processors as much as 15% higher because it was easier and cheaper for processors to source milk from a single, large farm than from many smaller farms. 2 dairy pretax they prices dairy

After cows were milked, the raw milk was then transported to facilities where it was processed into drinking milk, butter, cheese, and powders (both adult powders and infant formula) Most farmers sold their milk under contract to a local processor. In the typical market; three processors handled 85% of the volume. 27 Following deregulation of the industry in 2000, the number of processing firms had shrunk through acquisitions to the where the "Big 6" firms currently controlled 95% of Australian production; a handful of small processors did the rest. 28 The largest processor, Murray Goulburn had 40% of the market and had just been acquired by Saputo; a Canadian firm. Large foreign firms owned two of the other Big 6 producers (Parmalat and Lion &amp; Drinks) , as well. Fonterra was by far the largest processor in New Zealand and its Australian subsidiary was one of the Big 6. point dairy Dairy

While some processors produced a full range of products, others specialized in one or two products. For example, Bega focused on cheese and Synlait focused on milk powders. Similarly, some processors created their own branded milk products~ Fonterra had the Anchor brand while Murray Goulburn had the Devondale brand while others made private label brands for supermarkets or Besides milk, processors used machinery, labor, and packaging (cartons and containers) to produce finished all of which were available in competitive markets. The cost of a new processing facility, the most expensive input, ranged from AS20 to AS8O million depending on the facility' s size, throughput; and product range. 29 Because processing was a competitive business with high raw material costs, it generated relatively low gross margins and low returns on capital. Exhibit 6 shows and balance sheet information for the publicly owned processing firms in Australia and New Zealand. dairy goods \_ dairy profit dairy

Although branded products might signal safety or higher quality , consumers were unable to distinguish different types of milk based on taste. For example, Choice, an Australian consumer advocacy group, ran a blind taste test that showed there was no taste difference between generic milk and branded milk costing twice as much. 30 Despite the difference in retail prices , farmers received approximately the same for raw milk regardless of what final product it produced.31 Processors typical announced 'farmgate' the average expected for the year ~ in June and then made minor adjustments over the set milk aslow as possible to acquire dairy greater price price prices\_ coming They prices year.

After production and packaging products were sent to retailers for sale to consumers\_ Supermarkets, the largest distribution channel for products in and for milk in particular , bought milk from regional processors under medium- to long-term contracts. Supermarkets were also the major sellers of infant formula though other retailers such as chemists (pharmacies) sold infant formula; as well. The two largest supermarket chains Coles and Woolworths controlled 70% of the food market in Australia; two smaller chains Aldi and IGA controlled another 23%.33 The second largest distribution channel for products was convenience stores, a channel dominated by chains such as Coles Express, Woolworths Plus Petrol, and 7-Eleven. dairy dairy general dairy

Because consumers remembered the of only a few food items, and milk was one of them, supermarkets milk aggressively evenat a loss to generate store traffic:. Price competition also resulted from the fact that private label milk make up over 50% of the Australian milk market. 34 One of the grocery industry' s most memorable events occurred on Australia (national day) in 2011 when Coles cut the ofits private label milk by 33% to AS1 per liter. The other major supermarkets immediately matched the price and that had remained in effect through 2018. Although Coles promised it would absorb the cut itself,35 a farming trade organization claimed, Lower have pushed right through the system: Processors have no alternative but to pay lower to farmers."36 In fact, Murray Goulburn; the of milk to Coles, cut its farmgate by 15%. For many farmers, this new was below their total cost but not their marginal cost of prices priced Day price price price dairy prices prices leading supplier prices price

Despite intense competition at the retail level, supermarkets generated operating margins of 4% and pretax returns on capital of 10%. Within the category generated margins of 12% on private label milk, 28% on branded milk, 30% on milk powders, and up to 35% on infant formula. 38 dairy they gross

## The a2 Milk Company

Dr. Corran McLachlan  one of the scientists who had conducted the early research on the A2 protein, and Howard Paterson, a wealthy New Zealand entrepreneur and farmer , founded the company in 2000. Over the next 18 years, the company progressed through four distinct phases (see Table A)

In the first (2000-07), it focused on developing intellectual property (IP) and licensing that IP to certified laboratories around the world. trademarked the names A2 and a2 Milk@ which were phase They

particularly valuable because represented the products critical of differentiation (Al vs. A2) and could be used on other products: also obtained patents covering the detection of Al proteins in cows and milk, the process of A2 herd formation, and the beneficial uses of Al-free products. Initially, had six families of patents, a number that eventually grew to 15 families in countries around the world.39 Although some of the first patents expired in 2015 (ie, one for milk for the Al protein), others would remain in effect through 2036. According to Susan Massasso, the firm' s chief marketing officer (CMO): they point dairy They they testing

The   strength a2 Milk   Company's intellectual   property comes   from the interrelationship between a number of its patents, rather than any individual patent; and the interrelationship between the company' s patents and other forms of IP , especially protected brand marks. This IP position means that no one else can have complete freedom to operate in the manufacturing and advertising of an Al beta-casein free proposition in its entirety like we can.4 selling

Despite her assertion about the strength of the firm's IP , an industry blogger cautioned, "[IJt is best to use patents as shields and on them, but also best not to test them in battle. 41 bang loudly

In the second phase (2007-12) a2MC became an operating company with its own milk products. this phase, expanded into the larger consumer marketin Australia (population 22.2million vs. 4.4 million in New Zealand in 2010)42 through a joint venture (V) with Freedom Foods, a local processor. As part of its Australian strategy, a2MC built a small processing plant near Sydney and positioned its A2 Milk@ as a premium-priced value added product: 43 Instead of showing happy cows or mentioning competing brands, a2MC's advertisements showed happy customers and emphasized digestive comfort with slogans like 'Feel the difference" Love milk Better than milk; and Thank you A2" Like Coca-Cola "Have a Coke and a Smile' ), the slogans made an emotional rather than a rational connection to the product. 44 Massasso described the approach: During they dairy dairy again" (e.g

Imean, that s a pretty disruptive statement.  Were different. Not all milk is the same. 45 being get telling

In addition to targeting consumers  with advertisements, a2MC continued to invest in IP and formally developed "The a2 System@" comprised of the firm's proprietary commercial processes and know-how from milk supply through consumer sales. This phase was characterized by a clear focus on a single product (drinking milk)  with a few minor variations (whole vs. low fat) and a narrow geographic scope: Perhaps the most important move this was Geoffrey Babidge as CEO in 2010. Although he had begun his career as a chartered accountant; he had migrated into fast consumer (FMCG) and brought industry knowledge of food and nutritional products: He had been interested in the company for years. In fact, when he first heard about a2MC in 2006, he said, Finally , the company reached an important milestone in 2011: it earned its first after in business for more than 10 years. during period hiring goods deep moving profit being established the brand, the next phase (2012-15) was about expansion and growth as a2MC became a branded company a2MC expanded the product line into infant formula and the distribution network into the U.S., U.K, and China. Like its approach in Australia, a2MC created a sales and company also hired its first CMO (Massasso) in 2013 to drive awareness, product trial, and sales. Having dairy

The fourth and current (2015-present) was about "profitably making a difference in peoples lives across a wider range of footprint; and a wider demographic (infants to seniors). 48 CMO Massasso described this " Our biggest challenge is the sheer number of opportunities for us: Just choosing what to do and what not to do within our financial boundaries [is extremely difficult] " 49 But it was a nice problem to have: phase phase:

At the end of fiscal year 2017 (FY17), a2Mc had revenues of NZS5SOm and net income of NZS91 million, up 56% and 198% , respectively, over the year (see Exhibit 7). Through the first half of FYI8, revenue was up 33% and profitability was improving: its gross and net margins were 50% and 21% , respectively, and it was generating a return on equity of almost 40%.The company had a market capitalization of NZS6B and was listed on both the Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges. prior

## The a2 Milk Company in Early 2018

As of early 2018, a2MC looked more like a technology and marketing company than a conventional processor because of its emphasis\_ on R&amp;D and owning physical assets, it contracted  with firms the supply chain to provide the necessary services. For example, it contracted with farmers to convert their herds a2MC's genetic tests, and them a 10% premium to cover the cost of all cows, segregating them and a dedicated, Al-free supply line.50 It then contracted with processors in New Zealand to produce drinking milk Fresha Valley in 2009) and infant formula Synlait in 2012). Once this required dedicated facilities and segregated supply lines. To ensure quality, a2MC tested the milk company then transported finished to retailers \_ primarily the Australian supermarkets where it was sold to consumers. described the approach this way: dairy along using paid testing creating dairy (e.8 (e.8 again, goods large Babidge

Where we add value is in developing the science, the IP and sales, marketing, and distribution. We have a capital light-smart business model. We medium to long-term relationships in with outsourced parties that have complementary businesses where we are satisfied as to the quality of the product that is produced. 52 put place

Although 80% of its products were sold in Australia and New Zealand (Exhibit 8 shows sales by product and geographic segments) a large fraction ended up in China, particularly the infant formula. The market for infant formula in China was especially attractive for three reasons: the market was very large (see Exhibit 3b) it was growing rapidly (growth of 10% per year vs: 3% to 5% in other regions) and it was largely import-based because of a tragic poisoning incident in 2008.b a2MC met this demand in two ways. First, it had an exclusive distribution agreement with China State Farm Holding Shanghai, a state-owned agriculture firm with an extensive distribution network, experience  with high-end consumer products, and knowledge of China's regulatory system to sell A2 products through official channels online, in grocery stores, and through mother and baby" stores) These products had Chinese labels and trademarks. While the official channel accounted for about 12% of imports, a2MC also used the 'daigou" (Chinese for "buying on behalf of" ) channel, a kind of 'gray' market. 53 This channel  involved Australians, often Chinese immigrants, buying infant formula in Australia and shipping products with English labels to friends or retail outlets in China, a profitable arbitrage opportunity that circumvented the official channel's import tariffs and postal taxes. Because the daigou

b In 2008, 300,000 Chinese infants got sick and six eventually died after drinking infant formula containing melamine, a toxic industrial chemical inappropriately used to increase the formula' s protein level. This incident damaged the reputation of Chinese food manufacturers and created demand for imported infant formula from places like Australia and New Zealand. See A. Ramzy and L. 'Tainted-Baby-Milk Scandal in China,' Time Magazine, 16-Sep-08 Yang

channel was large and growing rapidly, the Chinese government was watching it closely and considering new regulatory proposals related to food import taxes, and labelling that could restrict, possibly significantly , the daigou channel. 54 safety ,

Although was still running the company in early 2018, the board had announced he would retire in July 2018, and be replaced by Hrdlicka. Until then, was in charge of daily operations and responsible for executing the firm's three-pronged growth 1) to create a broad nutritional product portfolio; 2) to target attractive regions; and 3) to develop proprietary know-how and expertise with the A2 protein 55 In short; it was a continuation of the technology and expansion strategies the firm had been following in recent The company remained asset-light and it still sold branded products at a significant premium. Exhibit 9 shows the pricing and cost structure for a2 Milk@ powder (adult not infant) versus conventional milk powder: The economics for drinking milk and infant formula were similar:. For example; a2 Milk@ cost AS2.40 per liter compared private label milk. 56 And a2 Milk@ generated operating margins that were five to ten times larger than the margins on branded conventional milk. Despite the large premium and an unwillingness to discount the product; a2MC had been able to grow sales rapidly and profitably. As the company noted, its 'flexible and scalable supply chain" had allowed it to grow and   generate attractive returns for on market to its success, according to Massasso; was the company's 'extraordinary amount of single-mindedness, agility, and ambition: 58 Babidge Babidge dairy strategy: years. dairy price price key

## Fonterra Enters as an A2 Partner

On February 21, 2018, announced better-than-expected financial results for the first half of FYI8 (see Exhibit 7) and a new 'strategic relationship' with Fonterra. According to a2MC, the deal encompassed a range of supply, distribution; sales and marketing arrangements' that would "expand a2MC's ability to build its business in new priority markets and beyond."59 In particular , Fonterra agreed to establish new Al-free milk in New Zealand, Australia, and possibly China; to assist a2MC's market entry strategies Fonterra' s sales and distribution capabilities; to the potential for a2MC branded butter and cheese; to supply infant formula in Southeast Asia and the Middle East; and to consider building a 'jointly owned packaging facility. Describing the deal, Babidge said, The company has been focused on broadening its manufacturing and supply chain and [this new agreement] will provide multi-site and geographic diversification and new product development opportunities:' 7 60 Fonterra' s CEO Spierings elaborated: Babidge pools using explore options

[It  will] unlock new opportunities ina wide range of international markets. Itis a win-win for both companies. The a2MC products promoted by this partnership sit well within our overall portfolio of products This partnership is all about finding ways to continue to delight our consumers and generate more value for our farmers. 61

Both the financial results and the new partnership investors who clamored for shares the stock closed up 27% for the at NZSI1.75. One investor exclaimed: The Fonterra deal is incredibly significant on a number of levels. What it implies is the IP around what A2 has is very robust, and [shows] the importance of an A2-only milk product and products:' "62 Keith Woodford, a pleased day having dairy

Three weeks later, Spierings  announced his resignation after Fonterra reported poor financial results for the first half of FYI8. In an interview , he acknowledged that Fonterra had been slow to recognize the value in the alternative milk company a2 Milk." 64

## Nestle Enters as an A2 Competitor

One month later , Nestle publicly confirmed that it had begun its own brand of Al-free infant formula in China under the name Illuma Atwo,65 and the press speculated it would enter Australia and New Zealand later in the year with similar products: Nestle, a diversified food and beverage company, had more than 2,000 brands and sales of CHF9O billion (NZS129 billion) in 2017 (see Exhibit 10) A Nestle spokesperson said the milk used to make the formula was sourced globally. It had tried to of A2 milk from New Zealand, but what was needed was not available" according to the spokesperson 66 Industry sources suggested the milk came from the United States. 67 It was not known; however, how large Nestles Al-free milk actually was or how fast it could be scaled up. At the time, Nestlé accounted for 18% of the infant formula market in China, and sold most of its products under the Wyeth brand name. 68 According to one analyst; Wyeth planned to spend NZS3OO million (~20% of sales) on marketing and advertising in 2018, far outstripping the NZS42 million a2MC had spent in China the previous year: The same analyst reported that Wyeth had ten times more sales assistants than a2MC had (7,500 vs. 700). 69 selling supplies get pool

Over the next two a2MCs stock fell 10% to close at NZS1240 representing a loss in market value of more than NZSI billion: One analyst explained the decline this way: days, price

[a2MC] have been lucky enough to enjoy a lucrative market in infant formula in China for a while now and have benefited significantly . Now you have a large player [Nestle] with very pockets that has chosen to enter the market. [a2MC] have had first mover advantage and we are about to find out just how strong their brand is.70 They they got deep They a2MC's however , saw differently: Babidge, things quite

Weve a very significant global company in the form of Nestle putting their toe in the water. That represents a very endorsement of the Al protein free proposition; positive about that. the first mover advantage; the strong brand position; the understanding of the science; the unique intellectual property: those are attributes for our company 71 got strong got things unique release explained why Babidge believed a2MC was in such a strong position: press

The a2 Milk Company is the only company engaged in the sourcing processing and marketing o solely Al protein free and nutritional products in global markets. This core principle contrasts significantly with likely new entrants who will need to consider how to communicate internally and externally the benefits of a new Al protein free variant whilst their traditional range of products continues to include Al.72 dairy

Recognizing the differing perspectives on Nestles a prominent investor said: entry ,

It is possible that Nestlé' s entry serves to grow the A2 market, however, it is equally possible that without protection, Al-free becomes commoditized to the that its unique proposition is eroded.  Either way the future for ATM [a2MC's trading in New Zealand] looks tougher now with the increased competition and increased marketing 73 dairy patent point symbol spend required.

As it turned out, Nestle was just one of several companies trying to enter the Al-free market. was facilitated by the expiration of a2MC's on testing milk in 2015 and the creation of alternative genetic tests for but was still hindered by a2MC's trademarks and patents; the limited size of In January 2018, one month before Nestle entered the Al-free market; China' s Mengniu; the tenth largest processor in the world, began Al-free drinking milk in China 75 Closer to home, Happy Milk, an Australian processor, announced it was building a NZS230 million factory to make infant formula Al-free and organic milk.7 Despite the competition; most analysts were still predicting a2MC would grow rapidly and generate attractive margins for years to come (see the forecast in Exhibit 11) Entry patent cows74 dairy selling Valley dairy using

## Conclusion

With Nestle now in the Al-free market, Babidge and his successor Hrdlicka had to decide how, if at all, to could respond directly, possibly aggressively , in China by increasing the firm's advertising expenditure; prices, or expanding its distribution network. Given the inherent risk of distributing products through the daigou channel , one would be to expand the firm's relationship with China State Farm Holding Shanghai. could also capitalize on the new partnership with Fonterra to grow sales in other of Asia. they cutting option They parts

Rather than focusing on the front end (marketing and distribution) a second would be to focus on the back end (procurement) by locking up the supply o A2 milk. could accomplish this objective by helping farmers convert their herds to A2cows and by signing long-term supply contracts with farmers in major markets such as the US. and UK By controlling a greater share of A2 milk production, could continue to grow while slowi the speed at which rivals could grow. option They they ing

A third strategy. Specifically , it could focus on growing sales in the U.S. and U.K; expanding into new product categories such yogurt; cheese, and ice cream; and developing the a2MC brand. option

A fourth option; although there were undoubtedly many others, would be to monetize the firm's IP and processing know-how by accelerating the adoption of A2milk products. A2MC could help other processors develop A2 products some form of ingredient 'branding (i.e , charging others to " use an A2 inside" just as Intel had done with its intel inside" on personal computers and Nutrasweet had done with its Under this option; a2MC would capitalize on the growing demand for Al-free products around the world. dairy using logo logo dairy

Regardless of which option or it pursued, one was clear:  disruptive innovation had come to the global dairy industry. What was much less clear, however, was how the industry would evolve and who the ultimate winner or winners would be. Clearly one of the major challenges for Hrdlicka when she took over in July 2018, would be to develop and implement a strategy for long-term success in the face of an evolving market:. options thing
