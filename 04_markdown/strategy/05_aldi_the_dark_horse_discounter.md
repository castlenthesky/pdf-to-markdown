Germany' s privately-held Aldi remained one of the world' s least-known discount grocers in 2013. Its low profile was due in part to Aldi's penchant for secrecy , a legacy of its reclusive founders, Karl and Theo Albrecht, and to Aldi's limited advertising: Aldi entered the US. market in 1976 but remained relatively unknown there nearly 40years later, even with some 1,200 stores in 32states3 alimited assortment of predominantly private label household items and groceries , including and fresh and frozen fruit, vegetables, and meats. selling= dairy

Aldi' s marketing  materials   asserted that its operating model makes  it almost impossible for   competitors to match and quality;"4 and the company in December   2013 announced plans to open 50% more stores by 2018, increasing its US. retail presence to nearly 2,000 stores and accelerating its pace of expansion from 80 to 130 new stores each year.5 As the U.S. had few similar grocers, with the possible exception of the more upscale Trader Joes chain; which Aldi owned (but did not manage). Yet U.S. discount grocers had strengths of their own Warehouse club stores such as BJs, Costco, and Walmart s Sam's Club format all offered low on branded that U.S. consumers already knew and loved. Walmart had a market presence, buying power, and breadth of inventory that Aldi could not match. Despite Aldi' s role in Walmarts exit from Germany in 2006 and U.K. grocery chain Asda into Walmarts arms in 1999, it remained unclear whether Aldi was capable of sustained growth in the U.S., Walmart's home market. unique price yet prices goods driving

## Aldi History

Aldi traced its roots back to 1948, when German brothers Theo and Karl Albrecht took over their mother's Essen grocery store6 and began basic items at low Few consumers in warravaged Europe had money to spend, and little but essential products was available 7 The Albrechts planned to expand the limited product range once the economy improved 8 However, while other grocers indeed increased product selection as the German economy recovered, the brothers realized could maintain lower than their competitors if did not follow suit but continued to limit their own product selection to basics.9 Choosing to focus instead on low and efficient selling prices . they prices they prices

Reputedly due to a disagreement over whether to sell cigarettes (which incidentally were prone to theft) ,i2 the Älbrechts in 1960split the company in two: one division in northern Germany (Aldi-Nord) run by Theo and one in southern Germany (Aldi-Sud) run by Karl.13 Dividing the company allowed each brother to make some independent decisions, though still shared information; including cost and performance metrics , comparisons of vendors, and some purchasing agreements 14 The only data never compared were the annual of the brothers' respective divisions 15 Combining the family name Albrecht" and the word discount; the first store with the Aldi name opened in Germany in 1962.16 they profits they

## International Expansion

In the late 1960s, Aldi stores expanded to Austria, and by the mid-1970s stores were operating in Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands. 2 The company made a impact in these first and by the early 1990s held a 5% market share in the Netherlands, and generated an estimated S1 billion in sales from its 260 Belgium stores by 1992.27 As of 2000, Aldi led German grocers with a 40% market share2s and had inspired a rival in Lidl, owned by Germany' s Schwarz Unternehmens Treuhand, which every aspect of the Aldi operating model. (See Exhibit 3 for Aldi's global retailers, and Exhibit 4 for the countries Aldi served and number of stores in each.) already captured 90% of German shoppers,29 however, the company turned to other markets for growth, entering the US. in 1976, and the Ú.K. in the late 1980s. foreign large forays, copied ranking leading among Having

United Kingdom Although Aldi was larger than any U.K. hard discount chain when it entered the British market in 1989, the company had to overcome several unexpected challenges. Brand loyalty among U.K. consumers led Aldi first to reduce its heavy reliance on private label and begin stocking some national brands in 1990.31 Second, Aldi initially found a relentless competitor in the local goods3o

discount chain Kwik Save, whose CEO pledged to match Aldi's and purchased 100 existing retail stores to limit possible locations for Aldi' s expansion 33 Aldi responded in 1991 with an agreement to open Aldi outlets at existing Gateway Foodmarket sites in the hope that Aldi's low would entice new customers to Gateway, which offered better selection than Aldi.34 In its first five in the U.K, Aldi opened 100 stores, about half of its rumored of 200.35 Aldi persevered, however, opening new stores at a compound average rate of 36% between 1990 and 1999.36 Surviving a UK supermarket war the mid-1990s without compromising its operating model helped assure Aldi' s place. Leading U.K. supermarket chains had all launched low-priced label product lines of their own by 1995, each containing some 125 items,37 and subsequently slashed on basic items including baked beans, bread, butter, and frozen turkey to defend Aldi and other newly-arrived leading casualty, with four other weak U.K discounters. 39 Aldi emerged unscathed, while Kwik Save went bankrupt in 2007 . prices32 prices years goal during price private prices against along keeping units, or SKUs) , compared with the 10,000 SKUs carried by the typical U.K. supermarket,40 and Aldi' s successful label focus had prompted local giant Tesco to create its own tiered range of private label products.41 Late in 2013, Aldi held a historic high 3.9% share of the U.K. grocery market; while the "big four" supermarketsAsda, Morrison' s, Sainsbury , and for the first time all lost market share over the same period, although remained much larger.42 Aldi also led all rivals in its growth rates, according to market research firm Kantar Worldpanel: The number of shoppers visiting Aldi increased 16% year-on-year at the same time as the average basket size has swelled by nearly 15%."43 In contrast; UK. grocery sales growth averaged just 3.2% for the period Kantar reported.44 The reason why , asserted one observer, was that, Aldi has been found to be 40% cheaper than Waitrose and an annual time] in Spain "45 (Waitrose held a 4.9% market share in late 2013 but was rated the U.K's best grocer in one consumer survey; Aldi ranked second.46) private Tesco they saving

United States Aldi opened its first U.S. stores in the rural Midwest in 1976; US. headquarters and an accompanying warehouse were sited in Batavia, Illinois. By the mid-1980s, Aldi operated roughly 150 stores in the and Wisconsin. 47 Distribution centers were built in Kansas , Iowa, and Missouri, and two additional warehouses were established by the close of the 1980s in Indiana and Ohio. Estimated U.S. sales reached the half-billion dollar range by 1989,48 at which the pace of U.S. expansion quickened, with new stores added both in the Midwest and on the East Coast. Analysts estimated that U.S. stores nearly doubled from about 200 in 1990 to nearly 400 in 1993, when U.S. sales reached an estimated S1.2 billion.49 In 2009, estimated U.S. revenues reached $6.5 billion, nearly 10% of total company revenues of S67.7 billion. 50 This compared to $70.2 billion in sales generated by Kroger, the largest U.S. grocery chain. 51 That year, Aldi ranked 25th among US. supermarkets,52 but the company' s accelerating expansion plans 75 stores were slated to open in 2013, well above historic levels53 \_ suggested that the company saw plenty of room for growth. point

The company' s focus on label products 95% of Aldi s U.S. assortment, compared with 22% of food sales nationwide54 remained central to Aldi's value proposition. Its limited assortment of approximately 1,400 SKUs per 17,000 square foot store in 2013 compared to as many as 45,000 SKUs for larger U.S. grocers.55 Approximately 40% of the store s display space was for refrigerated and frozen items, and some stores sold wine and beer.56 However, even 1,400 SKUs was a marked increase from the initial 700 SKUs Aldi offered in 2004 in its U.S. stores, and the 1,000 SKUs available in 2007.57 As elsewhere, Aldi' s accepted only cash or debit card payment. 58 private

and 30%-40% less than regional chain stores.60 To maintain fresh products and timely delivery as it expanded, one U.S. Aldi distribution center served every 55 stores. 61

## Aldi Operations

A central aspect of Aldi's model was the ubiquity of private label brands in its stores,62 ranging from Frisco Dent toothpaste to LaMissa hot chocolate mix.63 Aldi exercised rigorous quality control over its private label items with daily sampling and lab tests, as well as comparisons with other leading brands. Some private label products were manufactured by companies that produced well-known branded items also.64 The company claimed that; product we sell must meet or exceed the leading national brand in taste, appearance, and /or performance;"65 though such measurements were inevitably subjective: Yet third party surveys seemed to support Aldi's adherence to this tenet, at least for some products: in a U.K. taste test, Aldi came out on in 16 of the private label products tested, more categories than retailers Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose combined.66 More broadly , in U.S. taste by Consumer Reports , national brands won best quality in 7 of 21 categories, private labels in 3 of 21 categories  but testers dubbed national and store brands of similar quality in the remaining 11 categories.67 Bolstering Aldi' s own quality claims was its double guarantee" to both replace and refund any product that did not fully satisfy its buyer.68 These efforts appeared successful: in 2012, Aldi ranked among the top 20 companies (and was the only grocer) on Facebook with the most loyal fans , defined as those most likely to recommend the company, according to a third-party survey 69 "Every top leading testing

Despite consumer popularity , Aldi stores reflected the frugality of their founders   from their second-tier locations to their bare-bones Ranging in size from approximately 8,000 to 15,000 square feet worldwide,7 Aldi stores were generally located in nondescript but well-trafficked locations with limited  parking; the company' s real estate  purchases were made in cash. 71 Engineered for simplicity, Aldi stores were remarkable only for their asceticism. Instead of shelving and aisle endcaps, Aldi products were displayed on store floors in their cardboard shipping boxes, stacked atop (see Exhibit 5). Aisles in the U.S were about eight feet wide on average,72 and the company worked with suppliers to ensure that consumers could easily open the delivered cases to access the packaged themselves when a box ran out. 73 Employees memorized all to checkout until Aldi introduced scanners in 2001, almost 20 years after Walmart 74 Before this time, Aldi stores in Germany listed in only one decimal to ease this memorization. 75 Once Aldi converted to scanners, all product packaging came with bar codes printed on multiple faces of each item to ensure that cashiers could find and scan rapidly at the Store numbers were often unlisted to minimize employee interruption 7 And all employees were cross-trained. As a result, by some accounts, as few as four employees could operate an Aldi store. 77 design. pallets speed goods prices prices point prices register. phone

Product assortment, variety, and pricing were decided centrally ,   limiting store manager independence. In fact; Aldi offered only a limited selection among its limited assortment two brands of toilet paper, one brand of pickles78 \_ in only one or two container sizes. The idea was that selling just one type of most items made it easier for a customer to decide on their purchases , speeding up shopping trips. 79 Aldi stores turned over their inventory once each week on average, and 90% of Aldi product were directly cross-docked at Aldi distribution centers from the delivering vendor to the distributing Aldi truck without entering inventory 80

The essence of Aldi appealed to many shoppers for the same reasons that it repelled others. A 1994 company pamphlet outlined Aldi' s philosophy: When you a can of peas at Aldi, you're paying almost entirely for the can of peas. Aldi doesn't need to tack on one more penny to pay for an army of stackers or piped-in music or fancy display or check cashing or gimmicks and So your food dollar pays for what its supposed to pay for: food."81 But the low-budget ambience some customers off. As one observer contended, 'people charge around the shelves to out as soon as buy games. put get

possible."82 Another account claimed that Aldi' s initial U.K. and U.S. performance was hampered by unattractive" stores with very few products" and any fresh food in low-income neighborhoods: 83 Yet other analysts favored  Aldi's approach, insisting that certain customers are overwhelmed by the large formats and wide selections offered by modern superstores. are intimidated in stores and the lack of assortment."84 Karl Albrecht didn' t mind what others thought; he had been quoted as saying At Aldi, the customer is not We are providing not service, but mass production: "85 siting hardly They prefer large king

Shopping at Aldi did require some customer education; as its model required more consumer participation than at other stores. Shopping carts were released from racks only after customers deposited a coin \_25 cents in the United States; the coin was returned once the shopper had returned the cart to its proper location 86 Customers packed their purchases themselves at a separate packing station after checkout brought from home, purchased at the register, or product boxes Aldi made available to minimize its own trash. Most Aldi stores did not accept credit cards or personal checks, requiring cash or debit cards instead. Manufacturers' coupons were rarely accepted, as few to the as 25 to 30 selected items at appealing prices   ranging from watermelons to bath  products to wheelchairs, which were available for a limited time or until supplies ran out.87 In December 2013, for example, Aldi offered a tablet computer in its U.K. stores for E79, which sold out within 24 hours 88 Special were published in the Aldi weekly newsletter, the only form of regular advertising Aldi conducted,89 aside from its online presence. An artefact of its German origins, Aldi limited store operating hours to approximately ten hours per from Monday through Saturday , at either 7.00 p.m. or Aldi stores opened at noon on Sundays, for five hours. using bags bags applied Buys ending day

Aldi' s private label reportedly  appreciated the company's reputation for reliability: "Once a has been fixed, Aldi adheres to it relentlessly . Neither seller nor Aldi itself are allowed to rework prices, which gives security to suppliers\_This unique loyalty has helped some suppliers to grow with Aldi over the years."90 The private label brands were Aldi-owned but not immediately associated with the company; customers in some cases believed were a national brand from another part of the country 91 suppliers price they

Despite its penny-pinching reputation, Aldi asserted that its U.S. employees receive generous wages and benefits that are significantly higher than the national average. Employees averaging more than 20 hours a week receive full health benefits."92 Data from the U.K. bore out these claims.  Aldi salaries for U.K graduates who also received an Audi sedan and health and life insurance 93 The company' s program for graduate hires ranked third-best in the U.K behind only two accounting firms.94 As a result; graduate applicants flocked to Aldi, which enjoyed 12,000 for the 50 positions on offer each 95 college training years . leading college applicants year.

## Discount Retail in the United States

Discount retail emerged in the US. in the 1960s and caught on quickly: revenues increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% over the decade ending in 1970,96 by which time discounters generated $19 billion in annual sales, a figure that continued to grow throughout the 1970s at a CAGR of 9%.97 Several factors attributed to this steep growth trajectory, consumers who increasingly   accepted   self-service   improved   regulation of food  safety that boosted consumer confidence in non-branded items, and television advertising by manufacturers of retail 98 rising

Just three years earlier Kmart held a 34% share of the U.S. discount retail to Walmarts 20%.102 Over the following two decades, Walmart grew revenues to nearly S447 billion in 2011, far outpacing Target's S70 billion in sales that year. 103 Kmart failed to rival Walmarts low and supply chain efficiencies or Target's fashion-forward reputation; and filed for bankruptcy in 2002.104 placeloi prices

## Competing Grocery Formats

Trader Joe's In 1979, Aldi-Nord purchased Trader Joe's grocery stores, a California chain launched in 1967 that initially had featured local wines and specialty foods, including organic products, at affordable 105 Granted total managerial independence, Trader Joes began opening East Coast and Midwest outlets in 1996 and 2000.106 Like Aldi, Trader Joe' s offered a limited selection of privatelabel foods and household items, most requiring no refrigeration, though consumer demand in the 2010s had gradually broadened the chain' s offerings from frozen prepared food and frozen meats to include a limited selection of fresh produce, products, and prepared foods. prices . dairy

Warehouse Clubs As their name suggested, warehouse club stores were retailers that presented and sold household and food items in a warehouse format but; in exchange for low prices, required shoppers to purchase annual memberships and to show their membership card as a condition of purchase: Leading warehouse clubs included Costco (with an average store size of 143,000 square Warehouse clubs offered their members access to products from boxes stacked on pallets on the ground level; store employees replenished inventory by additional from overhead shelves onto the floor. Warehouse clubs packaged most of their food and fast-moving consumer products in larger sizes than supermarkets normally offered, or packaged bundled multiple supermarket-sized units together for sale as a single product: The product sizes were popular with restaurateurs and other small businesses , as well as with consumers. Assortment   consisted   overwhelmingly   of nationally-recognized branded alongside private label products in some categories; but warehouse stores offered few brands in each product category , typically a handful of shampoo brands, and two or three brands in most other product categories other than fresh food. Shoppers bagged their purchases with their own or in discarded boxes after purchase, which was done in cash or by debit card to minimize processing fees incurred by the warehouse club. goods moving pallets good large goods popular bags

## Walmart Stores

Sam Walton; founder of Walmart, built the chain in its early days on appealing to farmers, a consumer segment that greatly valued low 107 When new stores, Walton initially targeted small rural towns, those with demand just large enough to support one such store.18 Because these rural towns were less accessible to existing distributors, Walmart built proprietary warehouses to allow for to be purchased in bulk at lower and stored until were needed.109 Walmart's model of building its own warehouses and supporting logistics and IT capabilities to supply outlets far from cities was, however; extremely capital-intensiveto fund its first warehouse, Walmart went in 1972.110 IPO proceeds did not alter Walton's devotion to frugality , however: "On buying trips, his rule of thumb was that trip expenses should not exceed 1% of the purchases, which meant hotel rooms and walking instead of taxis."111 The company's motto was " 'Every Low Prices;' which meant offering consumers national brands at lower than department or specialty negotiated hard  with suppliers, its bargaining strength aided by its growing market power. prices . siting goods prices they public sharing taking Day prices

Although Walmart rose from humble beginnings to become the world's largest retailer, its U.S. dominance did not often translate directly to markets. In July 2006, for example, Walmart announced that it was pulling out of Germany, having found German hard discounters difficult to compete with, and German shopping labor, and retail regulation more than it had bargained for. 113 foreign

In the U.S., however, Walmart excelled by investing heavily in distribution logistics and information technology capabilities.  Walmart installed of sale scanners in the 1980s and ran the largest privately owned satellite system in the U.S. beginning in 1987 in order to transmit sales data, inventory data, and credit card approval requests.114 By 2012 Walmart had the IT capability to check on individual product sales both by country and by store on command, ,"5making it essentially the only source of real-time sales data for many suppliers. 116 point

In addition to general merchandise  Walmart began groceries   with the launch of its Supercenter format in the late 1980s,117 each of which employed an average of 300 people 118 Although groceries generated smaller margins with the operating margin on groceries estimated at about half to two thirds of a store's overall operating margin, with the difference mainly due to lower gross margins averaged 40% of sales at the typical grocery / discount retailer, drawing in customers to purchase higher-margin merchandise. 119 120 By 2012, grocery sales accounted for over half (55%) of Walmarts U.S. revenues of S264 billion. 121 Walmarts global revenues were nearly S444 billion over the same 122 Private-label products accounted for 38% of Walmart s offerings 123 Over time Walmart grew reliant on Supercenters, which sold " 'electronics , apparel, toys, and home furnishings"124 in addition to including full supermarkets and even pharmacies , banks, salons, or health clinics. 125 In 2013, Supercenters comprised 3,211 (78%) of Walmarts 4,092 U.S. stores126 and each offered some 100,000 SKUs within its average 182,000 square feet of floor space.127 Walmart stores averaged an inventory turn 73 times per year.128 selling they general period.

Walmart had begun experimenting with smaller format stores too. Walmart since 1998 had opened 319 standalone supermarkets, or Neighborhood Markets;' each averaging 38,000 square feet. In 2011 Walmart launched "Walmart Express' stores, each averaging 15,000 square feet and designed to create a presence for Walmart in urban and rural areas that were impractical for its larger format stores.129 Meant to access dense urban areas or the sparsely inhabited countryside, Walmart Express stores averaged 15,000 square feet and carried a similar product assortment to Aldi, including household items and fresh and frozen food. 130

## Ambitious Aldi

As 2013 came to a close, Aldi announced plans to open 650 new stores in the U.S. by 2018, increasing its pace of expansion from 80 to 130 new stores per year, investing $3 billion in new land, facilities, and equipment; and extending the company' s geographic coverage from coast to coast: 131 "Were ramping up our expansion plans to meet growing demand for Aldi from customers across the country' noted Aldi US. president Jason Hart:. 'Recently , we successfully entered new markets such as Houston; and expanded our presence in competitive markets like south Florida and New York At Aldi, we believe that great quality is affordable, and we are eager to the Aldi difference to new markets like southern California."132 Hart added that Aldi would soon introduce a line of organic foods. 133 Still unclear, however, was whether Aldi' s bet on the U.S. would pay off.
