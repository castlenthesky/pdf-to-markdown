## Dogfight over Europe: Ryanair (A)

In April, 1986, the Irish airline Ryanair announced that it would soon commence service between Dublin and London: For nearly a the new airline had operated a 14-seat turboprop between Waterford, in the southeast of Ireland, and Gatwick Airport on the outskirts of London\_ The founders of Ryanair , brothers Cathal and Declan Ryan, felt that service on that first route had developed well. knew , however, that the Dublin-London route would pose new challenges. For the first time, would face Aer Lingus, British Airways, and other established competitors on a major route\_ upstart year, They they

The environment in which the Ryan brothers launched their fledgling carrier had been shaped by Europe's national  governments Privately owned, commercial up in Soon, however, the governments of Britain, France, Germany, and other countries carriers. Each of these airlines literally carried the of its nation on the tails of its aircraft. Figuratively also, each airline carried the serving as an international emissary: Predecessors of British Airways, Air France, Lufthansa, and others   gradually became owned by, and subsidized by, their   national governments . The route structures of British, French, Dutch, and Belgian carriers developed to serve the colonial aims of their respective governments. For instance, the aircraft of British Airways' predecessor, the aptly named Imperial Airways, were familiar sights in India, South Africa, Australia, and other British outposts by the 1930s. Service focused on international routes from each nation's capital to colonies, other areas of national influence, and the capitals of other European countries\_ Intra-country service was sparse, largely connecting provincial cities to the Fares on domestic routes were often kept high to subsidize international service. long "flag flag flag'\_ flag capital.

World War II brought advances in aviation that made air travel widely economical for the first time. The aftermath of the war also brought the threat of American dominance in air travel. Had free competition been permitted on international routes , the efficient; privately owned carriers of the United States would likely have won the lion's share of the market. A set of multilateral and bilateral   agreements   averted this outcome The International Air  Traffic Association (IATA) essentially a government-endorsed cartel of the major airlines, emerged to set international fares: Governments negotiated bilateral agreements that regulated all aspects of air travel between of countries. In Europe, 'pooling arrangements' became common. Under pooling, the routes between, say, France and would be given strictly to Air France and Alitalia. The two carriers would pairs Italy flag

Professor  Jan W. Rivkin prepared this case as the basis for class discussion rather than to illustrate either effective or ineffective handling of an administrative situation.

Carriers were banned from flights that did not begin or terminate on their national soil; Air France, for instance, could not from Rome to Frankfurt or Milan. Intra-country service was also regulated strictly . To varying degrees, domestic fares were set by government authorities, and by new airlines was discouraged. pool fly entry

The collapse of European empires and the advent of jets capable of crossing the Atlantic economically led virtually all European carriers to refocus their international efforts on routes across the North Atlantic in the late 1950s. Heavy and growing demand for transportation to and from North America made such routes highly profitable, at least initially . flag

Europe' s system of regulation soon came under pressure. A late-1950s attempt to unify the carriers of France , West Germany , Belgium; and Italy collapsed under the weight of disparate national interests. By 1960, the Economist magazine bemoaned the state of the heavily regulated, fragmented airline industryThe basic trouble; it concluded, 'remains that the world has too many airlines, most of them inefficient; undercapitalised and unprofitable. Though the IATA introduced some forms of restricted, discount fares in the 1950s, consumers grew dissatisfied with high European regulations largely to regularly scheduled service between destinations. To bypass these regulations and to pent-up demand for leisure travel, charter airlines appeared and grew rapidly during the 1960s. These start-ups, funded in by shipping companies , offered holiday makers fares on non-scheduled flights and inclusive tours that bundled flights with lodging: Charter holidays proved especially among British and Irish vacationers, who used them to escape the North Sea for sunnier climes. By the mid-1980s, charter flights would transport 60% of all European passengers. carriers responded to the   independent charter airlines both   by establishing new discounts within the IATA structure and by charter subsidiaries themselves. flag Prices. applied tap part cheap popular Flag starting

The 1970s took airlines around the world into financial straits (Exhibit 1). The introduction as the 747 increased   capacity on the North Atlantic   route dramatically. The OPEC oil embargo raised the of jet fuel, and the ensuing recession cut demand for air travel. These events hit Europe's carriers, with their heavily unionized staffs and high fixed costs, especially hard. Exhibit 2 compares the staff productivity of European and US. airlines in 1978.

Twenty-two new, low-cost carriers entered the market between 1978 and 1980. Most of the new airlines soon failed , however.

A 1984 memorandum from the European Commission proposed the abolition of pooling arrangements, and government subsidies. Trade unions and carriers allied to defeat the In 1986, the Single European Act called for the creation of a unified European market by the end of 1992 The market was intended to " 'comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured .

## British Aviation and British Airways

While Europe as a whole remained dominated by state-owned carriers with governmentmandated monopolies or near-monopolies, individual countries moved to liberalize their domestic airline industries and to for international deregulation on a bilateral basis with individual countries . The United Kingdom was among the most aggressive in As early as 1971, Britain' s airline regulator, the Civil Caledonian Airways (BCal) as a 'second force' to compete with the dominant, state-owned British Airways (BA) Labor   Party governments, however , subsequently   protected BA from BCal's incursions. Though independent airlines such as BCal and British Midland operated in the U.K this period, momentum for airline deregulation up only after the election of the Conservative  market-minded Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1979. An early Thatcher bill required , for the first time, that regulators give the interests of consumers equal weight to the interests of operators when allocating licenses for new routes. push doing during picked

A hallmark of Thatcher's government was the privatization of state-owned enterprises , and a centerpiece of her privatization programme was a proposed flotation of BA on the stock market. The state of BA in 1979, however, precluded a privatization. The cost structure of BA and its predecessors had been high at least since the end of World War II, when the carrier was expected In 1977, the U.S. carrier Delta transported 30.7 million passengers with 31,000 employees while BA's staff of 54,300 moved 14.5 million passengers ' After thin profits in the late 1970s, BA suffered a loss of UKE1O2 million on revenue of UKEI,760 million in 1981. rapid flag

A new chairman, John King\_a self-made millionaire with experience in the ball-bearing industry\_was brought in to revive BA and prepare it for privatization: With generous severance packages, reduced BA's staff to 38,000 by 1985. Loss-making routes were surrendered to competitors, and maintenance stations and were shuttered. soon yielded the reins to Colin Marshall, a former executive of car rental agency Avis, who began to improve customer service Marshall particular attention to satisfying full-fare business customers. By 1984, BA was record (Exhibit and its privatization was planned for 1987. Deregulation slowed the period of BA's turnaround . A Civil Aviation Authority proposal to shift some of BA's routes to BCal, for instance, was defeated in 1984, largely because the Treasury opposed the plan. King training colleges King paid profits being earning during Ministry

In 1986, BA operated one of the world's most extensive airline route networks, serving 145 11 destinations in 68 countries. No airline   carried more international   passengers. International journeys accounted for roughly two-thirds of the seats that BA sold and nine-tenths of its revenue. Nearly 80% of passengers through London's main airport at Heathrow , one of the world's busiest transportation hubs. Plying the network was a fleet of 163 aircraft, ranging from 44-seat turboprops to Boeing 747s with room for nearly 400. Since 1980, BA had invested roughly UKE7OO million to purchase 55 new aircraft, mostly for service within Europe. The company was beginning to upgrade its intercontinental fleet:. passed

In the United Kingdom and New York, BA provided its own passenger and ground services for passenger check-in, baggage handling, and aircraft cleaning) . Elsewhere, it hired contractors to perform such services. BA catered its own flights from Heathrow, but contracted out all other catering; The company performed most of its own maintenance from a base at Heathrow and had engineering capabilities at three-quarters of the airports it served. (e.8

BA sold tickets over the telephone and in 171 retail worldwide, where agents also sold package vacations. In addition; 49,000 independent travel agents had the to book tickets on BA via computerized reservation systems, including BA's own system: Such agents accounted for 83% of the company's scheduled passenger revenue BA pitched its services to a wide range of shops ability

## Irish Aviation and Aer Lingus

As a country with a small population; limited land mass (roughly 250 kilometers across and 12 400 long) , and no colonial possessions, Ireland did not lend itself naturally to commercial aviation ' Yet in 1936, a mere 15 after Ireland's initial political separation from Britain and 13 years before full independence, government and private interests in Ireland came together to form Aer Lingus , a carrier for the emerging state. Government support proved crucial in the airline's early Annual losses in the 1930s and 1940s commonly ran between 20% and 100% of revenue\_ Not until the early 1950s did the airline earn a in consecutive years, and then only for a short years flag days. profit Period.

Early on, passenger traffic focused on routes between Ireland and Britain, where a population of Irish emigrants resided: To develop these routes, the Irish and British governments struck an unusual arrangement in 1946. Through BA's predecessors, the British government took a 40% stake in Aer Lingus, leaving 60% in the hands of Ireland. Aer Lingus was granted monopoly rights to routes over the Irish Sea. BA's predecessors the valuable right to land at Shannon Airport on Ireland's west coast, refuel, and continue on across the Atlantic (Aircraft ranges at the time required such a refueling stop:) In exchange, Aer Lingus was allowed to land in Manchester, take on passengers , and continue to continental Europe. Such 'onward rights' were rare in Europe and marked the beginning of relatively liberal bilateral agreements between Britain and Ireland. large gained

The British partnership continued for a decade until Aer Lingus' desire to develop its own trans-Atlantic routes, to reach the ethnic Irish populations in New York and Boston; created a rift. Amicably, the British government reduced and eventually relinquished its stake in Aer Lingus. The predecessors of BA and independent carriers such as British Midland began to fly routes between Britain and Ireland. large

Problems on the North in the 1970s hit Aer Lingus   especially hard. Compared to other carriers on the route, Aer Lingus drew its passengers especially heavily from the ranks of tourists. Tourist passengers actively sought promotional fares, created erratic of seasonal demand, and largely stayed at home the recession of the mid-1970s. The Irish government insisted that Aer Lingus continue to fly the North Atlantic corridor despite on the 13 route\_ peaks during losses

Aer Lingus first published its objectives in 1971 and had, by 1986, reviewed and ratified the statement a number of times. The statement called on Aer Lingus to provide an air transport service that was The airline touted the many benefits it brought to 44 balance of payments, and educational, social, and cultural services.

## Ryanair

18 Cathal and Declan Ryan had essentially grown up in the airline industryTheir father , Ryan, had worked for Aer Lingus. As the carrier' s aircraft manager, the elder struck innovative deals to excess capacity to other airlines. From 1973 to 1975, for instance, he arranged for an Aer Lingus 747 and its Irish crew to ply Air Siam's route between Bangkok and Los 10 In 1975, Ryan co-founded Guinness Peat Aviation, which quickly became the largest aircraft company in the world. Ryan's 10% stake in Guinness Peat Aviation gave him sufficient wealth to invest a million Irish pounds in his sons' efforts to launch an airline. Tony long flag leasing Ryan lease Tony leasing Tony

Both sons were in their 20s when Ryanair initiated service in 1985. At first, Ryanair used a 14-seat turboprop aircraft to run a scheduled service between Waterford in the southeast of Ireland and Gatwick Airport one of London's secondary airports. This initial service was intended to prove the company's ability to operate a scheduled airline successfully. In 1986, Ryanair a license to operate between Dublin and Luton another of London's secondary airports. gained

Aer Lingus and BA already operated on the Dublin-London route, which was reputed to be lucrative for both carriers. Indeed, Aer Lingus' Chairman noted that "Dublin-London is the only route on the Aer Lingus network that has the volume of business to allow of itself a reasonable return on capital. Aer Lingus' and BA's least expensive, unrestricted round-trip fares on the route were Discount fares as low as IE99 were available, though had to be booked one month in advance. Observers felt that the figures shown in Exhibit 4 were typical of Aer Lingus' and BA's average revenues and costs for a Dublin-London round trip. quite priced they

Ryanair managers believed that the flights of Aer Lingus and BA were typically 60-70% full. According to airport authorities, half a million round-trip passengers flew the route each year: The total number of air passengers on the route had stagnant for ten years.

Ryanair would offer meals and amenities comparable to what Aer Lingus and British Airways provided. The company would distinguish itself from the carriers in two ways. First   its employees would focus   intently on delivering   first-rate customer service Second, the company would charge a a ticket with no restrictions.
