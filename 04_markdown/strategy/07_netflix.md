## Netflix

Late one afternoon in January 2007, Reed Hastings had just concluded a with his senior management team in the board room at Netflix's corporate headquarters in Los Gatos, California. the founder and CEO of the company, which Pioneered online DVD rentals, was preparing to unveil Netflix's highly anticipated entrance into the online video market. industry observers believed that the of customers to order movies through their computers for instant viewing' commonly referred to as video-on-demand (VOD) would quickly impact the user base for Netflix' s core business\_ meeting King Kong Hastings, Many ability large

Hastings looked across the third floor of the office and the conference rooms named for some of his staff's favorite films. A love of movies clearly ran among Netflix employees, and he was confident that one way or another, his team would maintain the company's position as a leader in the home video market. But, as he reflected upon the years  of investment   and discussions surrounding the new feature that Netflix would be offering its customers , he could not help but think of the merits of the not chosen. building deep paths

As the management team filed out of the board room around him, returned his thoughts to the present. While he believed that the DVD rental market would remain healthy for years into the future, he knew that this announcement would impact not just the market's perception of his company but its ability to sustain its position as a giant in the media industry- With new resolve, returned to his desk to review his forthcoming announcement one more time: Hastings Hastings

## Company Background

Netflix, an online subscription-based DVD rental service, was first conceived by Hastings after he discovered an overdue rental copy of Apollo 13 in his closet: After paying the $40 late Hastings; a a software business, began to consider alternative ways to provide a home movie service that would better satisfy customers. The business that emerged from Hastings' frustration was a rental company that used the U.S. Postal Service to deliver DVDs to its subscribers. By year-end 2006, subscribers could use Netflix's website to choose from among over 70,000 different titles held on over 55 million DVDs. Through its 44 distribution centers across the country  Netflix could deliver to more than 90% of its 6.6 million subscribers within a single business Netflix' s offered unlimited monthly   rentals, fee,

## The History of Home Video Rental

When Netflix was founded in 1997, the home video market was a fragmented industry largely populated with "mom-and-pop' retail outlets. Customers rented movies, primarily on VHS cassette, from a retail location for a specified time period, usually between two and one week, and a fee of $3 to $4 for each movie rented. The market leader was rental   giant Blockbuster Inc Blockbuster' s success was based on the insight that movie rentals were largely impulse decisions. To customers deciding at the last minute that a given night was movie night; the to quickly obtain the newest release was a priority. Statistics showed that new releases represented over 70% of total rentals. days paid ability

Much of Blockbuster' s revolved around opening new locations, both to expand geographic coverage and to increase penetration and share in existing markets. In 2006, Blockbuster had 5,194 U.S. locations, of which 4,255 were company owned, with the balance franchised. Locations were chosen based upon a careful review of local data, including customer concentration and proximity to competition,   focusing on highly   visible stores in   high-traffic areas. Management commonly   proclaimed that   "70% of the US. population   lives within a 10 minute drive of a Blockbuster "1 highlighting how its retail network offered unmatched convenience to impulse movie renters. Stores were staffed primarily with part-time employees, averaging 10 staff members per store plus one manager. Occupancy and represented a significant percentage of total costs . growth strategy payroll

The nationwide network of Blockbuster  outlets carried a similar selection of movies, offering about 2,500 different titles per store. Shelf space in each store was mostly dedicated to hit movies, with the newest releases receiving the most prominent positioning; Locations acquired multiple copies of and high-profile movies, at a cost of about $18 per film Or DVD; in anticipation of high customer demand at the release date. Blockbuster's financial success depended on maximizing the days that any individual movie was out for rent. Stores were reluctant to stock numbers of lesser-known and independent films, since the demand for these titles was inconsistent.  With a relatively narrow selection of mostly familiar movies, customers could generally select a title with a sell   previewed  copies of its new releases at a discount,   generating incremental return on its investment and clearing shelf space for the next wave of new movies. popular large

Traditionally, any movies not returned to the same location from which were rented by the end of the specified rental were subject to extended viewing fees, or "late fees. In 2004, these fees represented In addition to the revenue benefit, late fees served a critical asset utilization function for Blockbuster . encouraged a timely return of each rented film, allowing it to be rented by another customer.

## Netflix History

Netflix was founded in 1997 the emergent of Internet retailing, when online competitors to traditional "brick-and-mortar'" retail stores were gaining prominence. Rather than attempt to attract customers to a retail location, Netflix offered home delivery of DVDs through the mail. during days

When its original website was launched in early 1998, most available movies for rent in video stores the VHS cassette format. In contrast, Netflix concentrated efforts on early-technology adopters who had recently purchased DVD players. Its marketing was to develop cross promotional programs with the manufacturers and sellers of DVD players, providing a source of content for customers. Hastings elaborated on Netflix's in its early "We were targeting people who just bought DVD players. At the time our was just to our coupon in the box. We didn't have too much competition.  The market was underserved, and stores didn't carry a wide selection of DVDs at the time. used strategy goals days: goal get

Netflix's website included a search engine that allowed its customers to easily sort through its selections by title, actor, director, and this search engine, customers built a list of movies, called a queue, to be received from Netflix. Netflix sent movies to its subscribers based on the order of titles on the list, with subscribers receiving a new movie from their queue upon the return of a currently outstanding film: Using genre.

Rather than replicate the model of video rental chains and lease retail locations, Netflix depended on the U.S. Postal Service to deliver DVDs to its subscribers. DVDs are small and light; enabling inexpensive delivery and easy receipt by nearly every potential U.S. customer related how he determined that the delivery performance offered by the USPS was satisfactory: "I went out, bought a whole bunch of CDs and started them to myself to see how quickly would come back and what condition would be in. 1 waited for two days\_and all arrived in condition. All the pieces started to fall into place after that."2 Hastings mailing they they they Perfect

Netflix initially used a pricing model similar to that offered by traditional video stores: Customers chose their film the company's website, were charged $4 per movie rented plus a $2 shipping and handling charge, and were expected to return films by a specific due date or be charged extended rental fees. using

Hastings and his  team used the models of the most successful Internet retailers of the time to identify characteristics thought might appeal to customers: (1) value, (2) convenience, and to value customers as customers , those to whom Internet shopping was an opportunity to target a great deal. Convenience and selection; in contrast, attracted the Amazon customers, those who used online shopping as an alternative to traveling to retail outlets and choosing among limited in-stock offerings. they "eBay

Netflix's early strategy extended beyond DVD rentals. While marketing a 2000 IPO, management described the company as the ultimate online destination for movie enthusiasts. with the DVD-by-mail service, Netflix was its recommendation to any user, whether were a subscriber or not, creating a Web rather than simply a subscription service\_ described this early strategy: "Our 2000 prospectus was spun towards that were hot it reflected a tension in our We would offer comparisons , theater tickets. That strategic tension didn't resolve itself until the bubble crashed. That summer we realized we weren't going to make it unless we did it on rentals. It was a cash-induced strategic focusing;' Along offering they system portal Hastings things strategy. Price

This focus was forced in by the adoption rate of DVD players among U.S. households, which became the fastest technology adoption in history; U.S. household penetration, at 5% in 1999, leapt to 13% by 2000, a level that attracted the attention of other channels. DVDs started sold at retailers such as Best and Wal-Mart and began replacing VHS cassettes on the shelves of advantage that Netflix offered to DVD viewers suffered in comparison to the video stores\_ The company shelved its plans for an IPO and struggled through a layoff as it began to adjust its business model in an effort to reach profitability. Chief among Hastings' concerns were the general customer dissatisfaction with Netflix's value proposition and the high cost of building a DVD to support the growing subscriber base. rapid part being large Buy large library

Feedback from early customers revealed a frustration with Netflix charging rental in line with competing retail locations while providing a slower delivery service. Neil Hunt, the company's chief product officer, described Netflix' s motivation for shifting to its no-late-fee subscription model in 1999: prices popular had been a discussion for a time Our original model didn't work\_we needed to overcome the   shipping wasn't a high   enough value  product to overcome the delivery time. We spent a lot of money to market to and attract new customers , and wouldn't be repeat renters\_ We were spending $100 to $200 to in a customer , and would make one $4 rental. There was no residual value Pricing long point delay. waiting they bring they

Hastings believed that to a prepaid subscription service could provide better value to Netflix' s customers and also turn their longer delivery times into an advantage. The first iteration of the subscription model allowed customers to have four movies in their possession at once and receive up to four new films each month. Hunt explained the effectiveness of the new pricing model: "We turned the disadvantage of delivery time into a movie at home all the time. The value to Netflix of our movies in the customers homes at all times was our insight: moving having having key soon afterwards, Netflix adjusted its pricing offering unlimited rentals for the first time Subscribers could now three movies at a time and exchange them as frequently as liked. Hunt explained the reasons behind this adjustment in strategy: Very system again, keep they quick

We made the observation that this change would dramatically simplify the program and make it easier to the service It also allowed us to market a more compelling value proposition; The term "unlimited" is marketing; We had some vigorous debates about this, but in the end it was a of faith. The dot-com boom was still in full growth mode, and everyone around us was growing fast. It wasn't the time to do months of and analysis. We had to make some bets and not worry about getting it wrong; At that time, the ones who it right would succeed, and the ones who it wrong wouldn't be around. explain great leap testing got got

With this change in pricing, the company added a new group of fans for whom movie rentals were a part of their daily entertainment of these high-volume customers were turned regular Many

off by the high cost of paying for each movie rented because of limited alternatives Others were dissatisfied with how late fees inhibited their to view movies at the times most convenient to them. If movie night'" was not an event but an ordinary form of entertainment, the option to hold movies beyond a two-day rental was important: For these frequent viewers, Netflix's "all you can model was an attractive alternative to the traditional per-day fee structurebeing yet large ability period eat"

Subscription costs, the expense of acquiring movies for rent, were still a major burden. Hunt explained the impact that customer demand had on managing the cost of building their film library:

We began struggling with a new problem: Half of the DVDs we were shipping out were brand new We realized that we had to fix that. marketing support and as a result had strong customer awareness and demand. Of course, those movies were the most expensive to acquire: We couldn't just blindly promote movies that already had external demand generation: We needed to stimulate demand on the older and less known movies and things already in our By marketing from the rest of the "tail" we could drive the average down of building our catalog: Top catalog; Price

Netflix initially relied on traditional merchandising to complement its search engine and connect subscribers to the company's library of titles. A small number of employees highlighted different films on the website' s homepage each week, effectively providing the same recommendations to all subscribers. Hunt explained the consequence of this marketing technique:

We started with a system that relied heavily on editorial content; but we realized that an editor could only write so many Web pages. Five movies would be highlighted on the website, then everything that was promoted was instantly rented out. That changed to a different five movies each of the week, and were all still instantly rented out:. We tried to improve the to ensure that subscribers weren't referred to movies had already rented. Eventually , we realized that the promotional value of writing the editorial blurbs was zero. day they they system

Realizing the inadequacy of the traditional merchandising system; Netflix engineers developed a proprietary recommendation system to better balance customer demand. Upon signing into a new account for the first time, customers took a short survey to identify their favorite movie genres, as well as rate-specific movie titles from proprietary algorithm then relied upon these survey results and the respective ratings of millions of similar customers to recommend films to its subscribers. The recommendations page not only included a list of titles with a ranking of how closely matched the customer' s preferences but also a synopsis of the film, a description of why the film was recommended , and a collection of reviews from other subscribers. As customers rated each movie saw , Netflix' s software refined its understanding of that customer's preference and more accurately recommended movies that would appeal to him or her. they being they to the success of Netflix' s inventory management was a filter placed between the output of the recommendation system and the results shown to the subscriber, screening for those movies that were out of stock. The intent was to avoid frustrating a customer by recommending a title that was not immediately available, but a side benefit was that new releases were rarely on recommendation lists, as were the most likely films to be in short supply. The system increased the utilization of Netflix's library of films by satisfying customers with movies already acquired and in stock, rather than requiring the purchase of more copies of newer films. Compared to traditional video rental outlets, where new releases would make up over 70% of total rentals, new releases represented less than 30% of Netflix' s total rentals in 2006. Hunt explained the power of Netflix' s recommendations: Key they

The recommendation system will pick the best movie for a customer , But it has to be something that can overnight. High-demand new releases are less visible because are less   frequently in stock. However , the customer   benefits from this We have recognized improved customer satisfaction by eliminating the "bait and switch" perception. Most revealing about the value of the recommendations is that are three-fourths of a star higher on recommended movies compared to new releases. Period. ship they system. ratings

While the investment in software engineering was modest, this shift marked a cultural battle within the company with those who   remained   loyal to the traditional merchandising   system: Hastings described his insistence on this change by highlighting another benefit: "A personalized experience is the benefit of the Internet. If you can otherwise do it offline, won't pay for it online. If our Internet was going to be better than stores, we had to find something stores couldn' t do well.' people offering

Movies are a taste-based product, for which many titles are consumed once. As such, consumers must make a series of purchases without knowing for sure if will like the product. Netflix' s website resonated with subscribers because frequently enjoyed the less well-known films recommended to them that might not otherwise have seen This software established a relationship with customers that was not matched by part-time employees at a retail video store, nor a competitor's service Netflix's size and growth rate also generated a positive "network effect" from its customer-generated system. Because it had the largest collection of movie ratings in the world, customers recognized that were more likely to have their tastes and preferences accurately reflected in recommendations from Netflix's site than any other offered by a competitor. only they they they large rating they

Even with the increased customer awareness of lower-profile films that Netflix' s recommendation system generated, building the company's movie still represented a major use of cash: As a small player in the video rental market, Netflix had no direct relationships with the major studios: It filled its film through relationships with a small number of movie distributors , at that reflected minimal discounts. front costs forced Netflix to choose carefully when stocking new films and often resulted in fewer than the desired number of of a title acquired. As a result, one of the major sources of customer dissatisfaction was the inability to rent new releases in a timely manner Netflix took steps to address this by Ted Sarandos chief content officer to manage content acquisition: Sarandos, who joined Netflix in 2000 from Video a major U.S. video rental chain, led Netflix' s transition to revenue-sharing agreements with the major studios: library library prices copies being hiring as May City ,

We were handicapped with vendors when I first arrived because other Internet vendors at the time had not been successful. As a pure rental business that was 100% subscription based and 100% Internet based, we were reinventing the wheel on three dimensions for the studios: However, it is very much a relationship business working with the studios , and I had worked with those people all of my career, so I managed to my relationships with me from my company. Within a year, Netflix had negotiated direct revenue-sharing agreements with nearly all the major studios. bring prior

Rather than pay an up-front of $20 per DVD; the studios would reduce their unit up-front in return for a fee based on the title's total number of rentals for a given period of time. Hastings described this transition with the company's "We spent more money, not less, with the studios but bigger customer satisfaction. It was like paying 20% more and getting two times the number of copies . Price Price suppliers: got

The benefit of the new relationships with the studios extended beyond lowering the acquisition costs for high-demand releases. Hastings recognized early on the number of customers who were

frustrated with the poor selection offered at many video stores, where shelf space is focused on hit movies and new releases. Customers interested in exploring a much broader range of movie titles were left unsatisfied by their Sarandos explained: "The that Reed and I connected on before [ even joined Netflix was the promise of a business model that promoted  lesser-known movies. Films outside of the 20 are not distributed widely. If you didn't see a movie within six months of when it was in the theaters, it often disappeared forever. thing options. top

The use of a national inventory allowed Netflix to satisfy the diverse demands of movie watchers , the same number of customers as a local network of Blockbuster retail locations with far fewer of a given movie title. Sarandos explained the difference in economics: serving copies

Half the equation of packaged media is allocation\_ getting the right amount of product in the right locations. This was more of a challenge for products that did not enjoy broad promotion. The trade radius of a single video store was so small that even a single copy of a lesser-known film had lousy economics: By a national inventory, we avoid that issue We never have overstocks on one on the other side. the subscribers' queues provides a deal of data By looking into the demand in the near future, we can near ~perfect inventory. Overali, we can satisfy demand in an area with about one-third to one-fifth of the inventory needed by a retail chain. using Using great replicate

In the summer of 2001, Netflix operated out of a single distribution center located in Sunnyvale, California. While several years of operations had allowed for improvements in this center, the majority of the country was still not able to next-day delivery of their rented movies. These extended delivery times were a barrier for Netflix in attracting and retaining customers in those regions. Hastings explained: "Post Office variability was on cross-country mail. It essentially meant one-week delivery times. So in the summer of 2001, we realized that regions with overnight delivery were disproportionately successful.  We tested the theory by upgrading Sacramento. The numbers popped quickly. enjoy long being

Netflix's Sunnyvale distribution center could serve the San Francisco Area with overnight delivery. But while outbound mail from Sunnyvale could reach Sacramento overnight; returns often took several Netflix tested Sacramento by arranging with the Postal Service to intercept returns at a Sacramento mail-sort center and then truck them to Sunnyvale. This would shorten the turnaround dramatically: Added Hastings, As we added centers in Boston, New York, and D.C., started performing like the Area. Bay days. they Bay

Armed with this evidence of success, Netflix quickly opened more distribution centers across the country  and subscriber numbers   continued to respond to the improved  delivery service The company promised 500,000 subscribers to its investors in its 2002 prospectus and delivered 700,000 at the time of the 2002 IPO. These changes in Netflix's pricing and cost structure allowed the company to profitability for the first time in the quarter June 2003. After establishing the viability of this business model, Netflix   continued to build its subscriber base and upgrade the customer experience by opening new centers (see Exhibit 2 for Netflix' s operating statistics). The centers themselves were inexpensive  investments; it cost about   $60,000 to convert an existing warehouse to Netflix's needs. The company   continually added centers to improve upon its nationwide coverage and reduce delivery time to its customers.  With the number reaching 44 by early 2007, over 90% of subscribers could be reached within one delivery The improved for Netflix to provide next-day delivery to more regions of the country allowed it to compete more successfully with retail video stores for new customers drawn by all three of the  targeted characteristics of convenience, value, and selection.

Netflix considered delivery time to be the measure of customer satisfaction and continually sought to improve the operations within each of its existing distribution centers. Much of the process of opening return envelopes and outgoing mailers with DVDs was still performed manually. However, with careful practices and thorough time and motion studies, Netflix's employees could open and restuff an average of 800 DVDs per hour, allowing the entire distribution center network to over 1.6 million DVDs per (See Exhibit 3 for photos of the distribution center operations ) key filling hiring ship day -

Netflix's relationship with the USPS grew. While the USPS was a general decline in firstwith  receiving the standard discount for presorting of its outbound envelopes by zip code, Netflix worked with the USPS to reduce the time it took to receive a movie return. Rather than deliver returns to the closest Netflix distribution center. And   recently, Netflix   began multiple "truck routes , supporting each distribution center to expedite returns. This shortened turnaround time for new movies and improved the overall customer experience. facing Along using

As the company added subscribers  content acquisition continued to grow in importance for Netflix. Sarandos explained:

For a technology company like Netflix, we are the group that is most dependent on art. What we do is probably 70% science, 30% art:. Our buying staff has to have their finger on the of the market to make their decisions: A high box-office performer won't necessarily be a high video performer, and vice versa The box office is an indicator, as a proxy for awareness, but not for demand. If rental demand for a title is lower than we forecast, it is a tax on the overall economics of Netflix's model. Even with the benefit of sharing, it is a margin eroder. If we underforecast demand, the problem is correctable, but it takes time: pulse Profit

As Netflix built its film it grew in importance as a distribution channel for many small and independent film studios. For lowerand independent films that did not enjoy the advertising support of major releases, generating customer awareness was a major priority. As Netflix became known as the best source for lesser-known movies, the studios began to look upon this partnership with increasing favor. Sarandos explained: library, Profile

It wasn't all about fulfilling demand for mainstream videos. We were also providing the studios markets for their films that were the earnings for some films. At Netflix, a lesser-known film can really succeed on its merits. large they

Hotel Rwanda, the Don Cheadle film about the genocide in Rwanda, is an excellent example: It enjoyed some box-office sales, but generally it was a difficult topic and a difficult film to market, with a low viewership. At Netflix, however, it is our fourth-most-rented film. The rest of the 10 are movies you would expect, but there is this wonderful independent film right there at number four. More have seen it at Netflix than at the box office. top people

In 2006, Netflix evolved from its de facto marketing efforts and began acquiring the distribution rights to certain independent films through its Red Envelope Entertainment subsidiary. Sarandos, who led this initiative, explained the shift in strategy:

Red Envelope Entertainment is 90% about content acquisition. While we do distribute films in other channels, including retail and other video stores , we did this to more excellent movies to DVD. Of the 100 films that are featured at a festival such as Sundance, only 10 will bring

make it to DVD. We are looking through the other 90 films for top-tier content to to our customers bring

By helping to high-potential films to market; Netflix hoped to enhance its reputation as the highest-quality source of independent films, a designation that contributed to its popularity. bring

As it was for many subscription-based services, customer churn was a critical issue for Netflix. In an was even higher, at 6.3% Since customer acquisition was a major   expense, retaining   existing customers and reclaiming old ones who had previously unsubscribed was a opportunity . key

Originally, customers wishing to unsubscribe had to deal with a salesperson by phone, who attempted to convince the customer to retain their account\_ In 2002, the company changed its approach completely; Customers could unsubscribe online from Netflix as easily as had been able to join. The only request was that a brief survey explaining left. Hastings believed that it was more fruitful to encourage departing customers to return later on than attempt to coerce unwilling customers to "We were on the AOL style of it really hard to cancel our service We realized, 'This is stupid. Its a false savings:' We turned it off, enabling the customer to unsubscribe on the website. We had a 30-day burst of churn, but we are convinced that it led to return visitors. they they complete why they being stay:

Instead of making Netflix a difficult service to leave, Hastings wanted to make it a service that customers would return to Customers appreciated the  personalized  aspect of Netflix's service, a dimension that continued to improve; The proprietary recommendation system grew more accurate in predicting a user's taste as the number of films rated by a subscriber increased. Hastings also emphasized the role of the customer's queue as a major retention tool: "Our is to invest in that are strategically relevant to customer satisfaction potential. The invention behind our subscription model is the queue Our average queue length is 50 movies. It turned out to be an amazing invention. Its our biggest switching cost. former explicit strategy things key

Just as importantly, a customer's was maintained if left Netflix. If the customer were to return, everything was already in place, as if had never left. Hastings found that growing the business in the face of a high churn rate was easier if many lost customers eventually returned. profile they they

## Blockbuster Responds

Early statements by Blockbuster dismissed the notion that its customers would benefit from an online rental business. In 2002, a spokesperson addressed the online rental market: "Obviously, we pay attention to any way people are getting home entertainment:. We always look at all those We have not seen a business model thats financially viable long-term in this arena\_ Online rental services are a niche market. '"3 public May things. serving

Three months later, clarifying that Blockbuster did not intend to launch an online business to compete with Netflix, a spokesperson announced, "We don't believe there is enough of a demand for mail order\_it's not a sustainable business model."4 Furthermore, the 2002 annual report made only a 7 cursory mention of the threat by online rental websites, with no mention at all in the "Risks posed

their core business model.

Blockbuster did not formally respond to Netflix until the introduction of Blockbuster Online in 2004. The offering first appeared in the company's disclosures in 2003, which included a tersely worded intent to launch an online subscription service during 2004. This service, closely matching was available in stores When Blockbuster finally did enter the marketplace, it did so with what Hastings described as a "land mentality , undercutting Netflix's pricing in an aggressive effort to recover lost market share: Blockbuster also tried to improve the performance of its service and distinguish itself from cross promotions, giving in-store rental coupons to online customers, and stocking online rental requests out of its store inventory , Blockbuster attempted to find ways to productively utilize its existing resources and improve performance for its customers: While by the of 2006 Blockbuster Online had grown to 2.2 million members, the 2006 annual report reported that Blockbuster Online still required meaningful advertising support and continued to suffer from "significant'" operating losses In the words of Hastings in 2005: "Were just thankful Blockbuster didn't enter four years ag0."5 grab" using end

Blockbuster also unveiled its no late fees" program, effective at all of its stores on January 1, 2005. differentiating their business offering from Blockbuster's due to the absence of late fees in their service offerings. This change in business was not without a cost. In addition to the $60 million of marketing and implementation costs of the program, Blockbuster chose to about $600 million of revenue by eliminating late fees. While early signs suggested this program resulted in increased traffic and rental volumes, it did not offset the of revenue as base movie rental revenue grew only 5%. strategy forgo loss

## Video-on-Demand

Netflix' s rise, industry observers   anointed video-on-demand  (VOD) as the "next big in home video. VOD was viewed as the marriage of pay-per-view programming combined with Internet downloading of entertainment, including movies and TV shows. The expectation was that viewers would search through a vast library of movies online and then watch a film on their normal TV set in a full-screen, DVD-quality format:. The increasing popularity of content delivery methods such as high-definition   pay-per-view and   streaming Internet video, as well as the participation of some significant well-funded players in the media industry, suggested that a VOD service fully integrating personal computers and television was not a question of "if" but "when. During thing

## Online Video Alternatives

Netflix had been following the development of VOD since the company' s inception, and Hastings sorted the available forms of Internet video into three groups. The first was advertising-supported video. Comparable to standard network television; newspapers, and magazines, this would include content that would be  interrupted by advertising: Due to the gap between potential advertising revenue and content acquisition costs, this channel would have difficulty supporting new-release feature-length films. More common content was expected to be user-generated video, television-style  programming   and older   films.  Online  participants   in this space in early 2007 regular

included YouTube and various network websites that contained streaming video (such as ABC.com and CBS.com)

The second channel would offer digital file ownership. This approach was similar to purchasing the latest bestseller at a bookstore or a DVD from a traditional retailer and would focus on featurelength films. Sites would let customers permanently download a film to a limited number of devices, similar to the purchase of music files on popular sites such as Apples iTunes. Revenue would not be generated through advertising but through the actual sale of content; at comparable to the retail of DVDs. price

The final channel was the online video rental and pay TV This channel was characterized by limited rights and finite durations common to traditional rentals. Like digital file ownership, this channel would offer primarily feature-length films with limited advertising support. Revenue would be generated through low-priced (around $3) temporary downloads. This was the segment of the market in which Netflix expected to participate.

## VOD Competition

By early 2007, the VOD market had already attracted multiple competitors with approaches that spanned the three delivery channels. Stand-alone online VOD services included Vongo, launched by the Starz subscription cable channel, and CinemaNow , a venture formed by Lionsgate, Microsoft, and Cisco offering a few thousand titles from major studios. Depending on price, customers were able to rent movies for a limited time, purchase them for on a limited number of devices, or even burn them directly to a DVD. viewing

Other participants relied on a box to bypass the computer and films directly to the user's television MovieBeam was investors\_ Customers purchased a set-top box in advance and per movie viewed, choosing among a limited but regularly refreshed selection of films. In early 2007, MovieBeam was acquired by Movie Gallery Inc , the second-largest video rental chain in the US. bring set-top

Blockbuster announced in early 2007 that it was in talks to acquire MovieLink, a venture between several major studios (including MGM, Paramount, Warner   Brothers, and Universal)   that offered a pay-per-view downloading service, with a of about 1,500 films. Sony, library

Traditional cable and satellite providers also offered on-demand delivery at an increasing pace. were thought to have a head start since already had a share of use of the television set and did not require the user to purchase new equipment:. Cable and satellite providers offered an expanded and more flexible pay-per-view system, providing high-definition on-demand programming and a growing number of "free offerings included as of the monthly fee. they large They regular part

All of these services had two primary limitations to broader appeal: technology and content availability VOD was perceived as limited until hardware to connect a user $ computer to their television was more widely available; With the increasing adoption of big-screen; high-definition televisions, consumers were unwilling to pay equivalent for movies that could only be viewed on their computers. prices

Even more was content availability. Concern about pirated downloads and a lack of urgency to supplant their profitable DVD sales made studios reluctant to offer much content to VOD websites. described the U.S. rights of physical media and the consequences had on the studio's cooperation with online video distribution: "U.S. laws enable anyone to a DVD and rent it as many times as want. We can g0 to Wal-Mart, DVDs, and place them in our rental limiting Hastings they buy they buy

## Hunt concurred with his analysis:

A member of the can purchase a DVD for $20 at Wal-Mart, but most people are not prepared to pay $20 and watch a movie only once want to pay $1 per hour of viewing' This does not hold in an electronic media market: Without the rights for an external party to rent their content, studios believe the proper for their content is $20 per viewing even for a rental. Therefore, online content is limited to older or less films that a limited sell-through market that we can more cheaply. public They price popular have get

## Online Video at Netflix

Most industry observers believed that the emergence of a viable VOD technology a threat developed VOD offering, customers would no longer have to choose between selection and impulse rentals. Those who found online DVD rentals and traditional video stores to be inconvenient would now be able to watch their   selection immediately , without waiting for it to arrive via the mail or even their home. While the of mass adoption of VOD was unclear , it appeared that the long-term success of Netflix would require some consideration of this new delivery method. posed fully leaving timing

Throughout the company's history , Hastings had repeatedly stated that Netflix's purpose was not to provide DVD rentals through the Internet but rather to allow for the best home video viewing for its customers\_ Hastings stated in a 2003 interview , in response to a question regarding video-ondemand, "Our is that we'll eventually be able to download more movies. Its we named the business Netflix and In fact, the company publicly stated its plans to offer VOD services as early as 2001. Hastings' attitude revealed his belief that Netflix could address this growth opportunity early on. Rather than view VOD as an that could only appeal to a niche customer set, he seemed responsive to the benefits it could provide to the mass market. hope why option

Early development of an online video feature was also a matter of preparedness. The company had been dedicating cash for investment to VOD for several years , including $10 million in 2006 and plans for an additional S40 million in 2007 even as it grew its core online rental business. Hastings recognized that the resolution of the two impediments to widespread adoption of VOD, the connectivity between a user $ computer   and television and the current   limitations   in available content, were, to a degree, beyond the scope of   Netflix's core focus , which was movie recommendations and delivery. Given the pace of technology improvement; it was critical that Netflix have a functional VOD offering in when those issues were resolved. large large place

Another challenge was lack of an obvious customer for any online feature: Hastings and his team searched for a group that could serve as their "beachhead, becoming early adopters for this streaming video offering; But no niche group of viewers emerged around a particular genre to drive early demand for Netflix' s online viewing offering; base viewing

Through this investment and development\_process , and his team had reviewed three alternatives for Netflix's online video feature. The first was a licensing arrangement through which the company would offer its proprietary   recommendation to cable providers seeking to enhance their Management   recognized that Netflix' s greatest asset was the Hastings system

personalized user experience created by the ratings and recommendations system. there was an opportunity to license the strongest part of its business model and effectively outsource delivery to the cable companies  much as was done with the USPS. Cable subscribers could, for an additional fee, use the Netflix website and benefit from its familiar recommendation system, ordering movies for instant viewing on their television. This would also bypass the technology challenge of connecting a user $ computer with their television; and a VOD feature that did not rely on mitigate concerns over piracy and accelerate   premium-content   acquisition. While this might eventually cannibalize the core business, Netflix would be replacing one stream of positive cash flows with another. Despite these benefits, Hastings was still uncomfortable partnering with a competitor. With the fast pace of technology   improvements ,   what was the likelihood that a satisfactory connection between a user' s computer and television would emerge shortly after settling on this sort of agreement? Perhaps

A second was to integrate a streaming online video feature into their core offering; The rationale here was to take advantage   of Netflix's   existing   strengths   including its   brand, its recommendation system, and its market share of online customers. By the streaming feature at no additional cost to the existing online DVD rental business, Netflix could increase its penetration of the young VOD market simply by continuing to grow its existing business. believed that leveraging Netflix's existing brand and market share was the only way to differentiate his business from the stand-alone sites such as Vongo and MovieLink. Without a clear link between the streaming offering and the traditional DVD rental business, Netflix's VOD offering would have no advantage over those of its start-up competitors. Still, Hastings was concerned with what was effectively giving away this new feature for no additional revenue While online delivery meant no shipping costs and no additional employees needed to handle extra volume in a distribution center there were still-content acquisition costs for online video, with a material amount of programming support needed: Part of Netflix's early success had been to reach for positive cash flows before growing wildly . Hastings wondered if this was a in the wrong direction. option offering large Hastings along step

Finally, he considered the merits of building a stand-alone online video business, similar to what was offered by Vongo or MovieLink. Hastings was somewhat concerned with distracting his core team from his stated of growing Netflix' s core business to 20 million subscribers. He was worried that these same employees to pursue an online video initiative would create some confusion about the future of the company . One solution would be to create a separate center and an entirely different service through which customers would pay exclusively for online video access While acknowledged that the market for this service would be small in early 2007, he believed that there would eventually be resolution for the content and connectivity, allowing this market to mushroom When this happened, he was confident that the Netflix brand name and customer awareness would give it a distinct advantage over many newer entrants\_ being goal asking Hastings

The announcement was just away. days
