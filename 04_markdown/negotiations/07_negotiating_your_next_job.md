## IDEA IN BRIEF

## THE PROBLEM

In job negotiations professionals too often focus on pay and benefits and fail to think more broadly about how the opportunity will fit into their long-term career goals

Work backward your career objectives to define the next steps you want to take. Be mindful of whether you 're proposing something standard. an unusual arrangement for yourself, or an idea that w√¨l change the organization fron

Although reaching agreement on pay and benefits is important, failure to think more broadly about your career could mean valuable opportunities for advancement. For instance, women are increasingly to negotiate for higher pay as a way to close the gender wage gap. However, studies have shown that womens "80 cents on the dollar? is explained more by differences in men's and womens career trajectories than by differential pay for the exact samejob. Our research and our work coaching executives suggest that negotiating your role (the scope of your authority and your developmental opportunities) is likely to benefit your career more than negotiating your pay and benefits does. And at times of work-life conflict, negotiating your workload and the conditions that affect it (including your losing urged doing

As with other dealmaking, career negotiations should not be solely about getting as much as you can. Thebest negotiators generate mutually beneficial solutions through joint problem-solving and creative trade-offs, with compromise. Furthermore, negotiating the direction ofyour career typically involves multiple stakeholders~including those in your personal life as wellas those at work. along

In the age of Covid-19, the time is ripe to improve your career negotiation skills. people are changing how work (shifting to remote or flexible arrangements; for exam ple), what are working on (being redeployed or respond to new priorities) , and with whom they' re working (collab orating in new ways across functions and geographies). And transformations in our work lives are increasingly interlinked with transformations in our personal lives\_whether that involves relocation decisions, periods ofintense dedication to our jobs, Or adapting to spikes in caregiving demands. Many they they ing

We advise professionals to think strategically about not just whatmight negotiate but how: That means going beyond planning what to say at the bargaining table; it requires keeping your eye on larger objectives; ensuring that you are negotiating with the right parties over the right issues, and preventing misunderstandings from derailing your requests or proposals because they are unconventional Or potentially pathbreaking. they

Drawing from a research project in which we collected thousands of stories from recent professional-school ates, mid-level managers, and senior executives from seven global regions about how advanced at pivotal points in their careers, we propose four steps for preparing for your career negotiations. They progress in alogical order, but you are likely to return to earlier steps as your analysis proceeds. For instance might start out intending to negotiate for one type of opportunity but discover that you're better off negotiating for a different type. Or you might initially conceive ofa proposal to present to boss but then come to understand that your boss is actually not the stakeholder who needs to be persuaded . Particularly for a complex and protracted negotiation; you should continually refine analysis as you information. gradu they you your key your gain

## Start with Your Career Goals

In our experience; negotiators too often start their prepara tion focused on the opportunity right in front of them, such as a job offer, rather than on their ultimate work and life aspirations. As you enter a period of change in your career , you should think about your short- and long-term aims and then map backward from those objectives to define the next steps you want to take. Don't forget to include quality-of-life considerations as well as professional ones. And be prepared todefer gratification ifthats the right todo for the endgame. thing

Making compensation the deciding factor can be a mistake. Ifwed been coaching we would have encouraged her to start with her career transitioning out ofconsulting into tech. We would have encouraged her tocompare the compet offers not only with each other but also against her vision of what she wanted to achieve in her first five years out of graduate school. Next we might have asked, "To improve the tech offer, what might you negotiate to fulfill your dream of a career in tech?" After all, her lifetime eamning potential could behigher in that booming sector than in consulting. Perhaps she could accept the lower compensation but negotiate for an accelerated promotion track\_a solution that might appeal to the tech company because it would not need to deviate from its compensation standards for MBA recruits. goal:

Anya's story offers a cautionary tale. ( Anya" and all other individuals discussed in this piece are composites of case examples we studied.) When finishing her MBA program, she was evaluating two offers: one in consulting the field she had previously worked in for several years and one that would launch a new career in tech, which was what her heart truly desired . (Feeling torn between two industries is com mon in job searches.) The consulting firm was offering her more money and status than the tech company was unsur prising; given her track record in consulting and her limited experience in tech (one summer internship). Focused on the terms of the offers, Anya started her negotiation preparation wondering if she should walk away from the tech company unless it matched the salary offered by the consulting firm.

Such longer-term thinking often pays off. In Chasing Stars: The Myth of Talent and the Portability of Performance, Boris Groysberg reports that the financial analysts who were most likely to retain their star status after moving to anew firm were those who had looked beyond pay and carefully researched whether the new firm would provide them with the organizational resources to excel. understood that success fulin one setting doesn't guarantee success in another, so the compensation package was just one aspect of the job offer to consider. Our advice is to define from the start what you most want to achieve\_whether thats a professional, making money; or living up to some other ideal\_and then keep that in mind as your negotiation progresses . being They being top goal

## Understand What You're Negotiating For

Career negotiations fall into three buckets. In asking negoti ations; you propose something that's standard for someone in your role or at your level. In bending negotiations; you request a personal exception or an unusual arrangement that runs counter to typical organizational practice or norms (for example; a remote work setup or a promotion to a position for which you lack the conventional qualifications) . And in shaping negotiations, you propose ways to play a role in changing your organizational environment or creating a new initiative (such as revamping the way a project is run or launching a new business unit). Depending on whether you are in an asking, a bending, or a shaping negotiation; you will need to vary your arguments to win counterparts' support. your

In asking situations, you must demonstrate that your request or proposal is reasonable because it fits with existing practices or norms\_for example, a pay raise is warranted in light of an outside offer, or you deserve a promotion or a developmental opportunity because other employees with your track record or experience have received such rewards\_ Asking negotiations often arise in the context of routine conversations about role assignments. If you are asked to do work that would move you away from your career goals,

see if there is room for negotiation. For instance, might be able to explain why the proposed change in your role is not in the employer's interest: Perhaps it would hurt the performance of your team or damage the relationship with a high-value client. Another option is to agree to do the job for the sake of organizational needs in exchange for some other career-advancing opportunity. For example, you might say, "Iwilltakeon this role to help us out of the current crisis, but Iwould like to rotate into a job with more P&amp;L responsi after two you bility years:

Consider the case of Bela, who wanted to move from finance into a leadership role in IT as her company launched a digital transformation: The CIO considered her unqualified and seemed likely to dissuade the CEO from giving her the job. Bela came to realize that the CIO wanted someone more experienced to oversee the IT transition; in part because failure would reflect poorly on the CIOs own leadership. So she asked for a six-month trial while the CIO searched for a potential replacement . Bela explained why her deep knowledge of the company's financial systems and her track record managing cross-functional teams prepared her to succeed in this IT role or, at a minimum, keep the company on solid footing untilshe was replaced by a new hire.

If you are in a bending negotiation~seeking some special exception or privilege\_you need to your counterparts from whats easiest and simply saying, thats not the way are done around here: Justifying your request is particularly important if you are asking people to take a chance on you; such as putting you in a position for which you are not traditionally qualified. keep doing "No, things

Although any negotiation can backfire, bending negotia tions are particularly risky because may give the impression that you're a prima donna seeking : treatment or unwilling to pay your dues. Deborah Kolb, an expert in career negotiations; suggests a role-play exercise to mitigate this risk: List the reasons why your counterparts would support your proposal; then come up with a of reasons why might say no anyway\_and your possible responses. Beyond strategizing to past we advise weighing the downstream career risks and benefits of entering into an exceptionalor unconventional work arrangement \_ special list they get

Whereas asking and bending negotiations are focused solely on your personal career path, shaping negotiations

center on proposals to change the of your organization Or working group. Because that commonly means seizing leadership opportunities, shaping negotiations typically involve more parties and the backing of allies. path and social distancing restrictions, many employees need to change the way they work. Their collective bending negotia tions are a useful source ofinformation and experimentation for organizations and individuals trying to figure out how to maintain high morale and productivity during the crisis. Organizations are also welcoming shaping proposals from employees who have ideas about how to redeploy resources andopen new markets in response to economic disruptions at home and abroad

## Reduce Ambiguity About What, How; and with Whom to Negotiate

Consider Samir's desire to lead a which was run by an elite old that he saw as out of step with globally competitive business practices. Samir recognized that he needed to build a cross-generational coalition to support this change. As he made his case to 'colleagues; he found allies among the veteran leaders who recognized that the firms legacy would depend on retaining bold thinkers like him. He also found peers who appreciated his vision for a plan to relocate internationally for another position if the firm rejected his proposal. He then began the negotiation process with confidence that he had enough buy-in within the firm to lead a transformational change, but also a satisfying alternative for himself and his family if that was not possible. guard key

Noone would ever advise walking blind into a potential negotiation;, but people do it all the time. One risk is that you'll "get Wahlberged, as the journalist Kate MacArthur it, writing about how Mark Wahlberg negotiated a payment of $1.5 million to reshoot some scenes in a Hollywood put

Organizations may be especially receptive to bending and shaping negotiations during challenging or fast-changing times, when people are looking for ways to adapt and innovate. For instance, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic

## Stretch your inquiry beyond your closest networks to ensure that you have the broadest information possible;

film while his costar Michelle Williams accepted less than $1,000 for the same work. That case has been highlighted as an example of women's failure to negotiate, but the underly ing problem was a lack ofinformation on what was negotia ble. Williams had been led to believe that all the actors on the reshoot were effectively donating their time to save the film after another costar was pulled from the cast.

Reducing ambiguity is particularly important for ensuring that people from underrepresented groups oftentimes women and people of color a fair shake. Many organizations are moving to make their recruitment and promotion practices more transparent so that all candidates have access to the same information and opportunities . Increasing trans parency is obviously the responsibility of organizations; but individuals can take action too. get

As you prepare to negotiate, write down all the questions you have: What is potentially negotiable? How should Inegotiate? Who willbe my counterparts, and what do care about? There are many sources for this type of information Talent professionals, for example, will explain in general terms what is typically negotiable and how (although usually won't reveal the specifics of any individual case). Some information is available online. Amedia or YouTube search can give you perspective on counterparts' points of view on strategic issues. A LinkedIn search can help you find professional contacts who may tell you more about a hiring manager or a department. theythey

Although your personal and professional networks can be a valuable source ofinformation, you should not rely on them alone to get an unbiased understanding of the situ ation. Think ofa field in which men tend to be better than women. If women confer only with other women about customary salaries; and if men confer only with other men, women are likely to enter pay negotiations with lower expectations than men have-and to exit with worse outcomes. paid

Stretch your inquiry beyond your closest networks to ensure that you have the broadest information possible. Recently many people have been learning from how organi zations in other industries or 'geographies = are responding to the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic. Better information helps generate innovative solutions; it can also help you make a persuasive case for managing your career the way you want to during these turbulent times.

## Enhance Your Negotiations Through Relationships-and Vice Versa

Consider the example of Brandon, an engineer who landed ajob as a private equity associate after finishing business school. Lacking finance experience, he had been advised that his prospects of making partner were dim ifhe did not make a distinctive contribution. Brandon hoped to do that by arguing for the creation of a small fund to invest in marketable robotics projects-an underdeveloped growth area for the firm. Before negotiating to spearhead this ini tiative he sought advice from his former robotics professor, who could spot weaknesses in his proposal and help him fix them. He also found a partner at the firm who agreed to let Brandon shadow him on tech company boards .

As you aim to reduce ambiguity; you will undoubtedly think of people you might go to for information or advice. You might also think of others who could provide socialsup port\_those who would encourage and stand by you and give honest feedback if you are off track. Don't forget to identify potential advocates for your proposal. Who might be willing to speak up in favor ofit? Who are your allies? Connecting with people who can be helpful is what we mean by enhancnegotiations through relationships. your

Tobuild a coalition of support for what you to you might start offby trying something akin to the shuttle diplomacy used by negotiators of international affairs: Make the rounds of stakeholders, talking with them individually to solicit their feedback and input. Shuttling is more timeconsuming than calling a summit of all interested parties (a meeting to pitch your proposal) . But it enables you to privately explore peoples interests and concerns and to incorporate their ideas into your game plan. It also helps you predict how people will respond when it comes time for you to present a formal proposal. hope do, key-

Ifyou're concerned that shuttling around might make you appear conniving or manipulative; then be transpar ent about it Explain that you're seeking input on an idea you have; and meet early with people who might block

felt you weren't consulting them. To broaden buy-in, you might also enlist others to help you get feedback, keeping in mind Truman's words: "It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who the credit: they Harry gets

To generate goodwill and motivate agreement; we recommend that you explain to counterparts both why it is legitimate for you to be negotiating and how your proposal takes their interests into account. Thats not easy For instance, we met one female executive who found out for the second time that a male subordinate was always = paid being ofthe negotiation cases we studied were rife with tales of conflict and resistance, but you needn't settle for compromises that leave both sides unhappy.

In other words;, career negotiations can enhance your working relationships-and we encourage you to strive for that outcome Many

Or take the example of Sandra, who ran the U.S. divi sion of a major business unit and wanted to globalize it. To achieve her aim;, she had to make a strategic case for why globalization was in the company's best interest and why she was the right person to lead the initiative. Addressing the hopes and concerns of managers both at headquarters and in the non-U.S. business units required numerous rounds of conversation in which she seeded and got feedback on her ideas. Sandra told us: time, the logic [for globalization and my leadership] became compelling:' "Over

THE FOUR STEPS outlined above take time to implement \_ and there will be false starts and reversals. Most of the career negotiations recounted to us by senior executives, managers, and other professionals lasted weeks or months. They started with preliminary conversations that gradually evolved, par ticularly as new information or the entrance of new players influenced the way various parties perceived their interests and the alternatives to agreement.

One senior executive we interviewed told us, &lt;You have a book to write of your life. Don't let anyone else write your chapters: We second that, but we also urge to remember that great careers are not authored alone. narrative will be cowritten with work and life partners, and negotia tion is at the heart of 'finding mutually gratifying ways for that story to unfold .
