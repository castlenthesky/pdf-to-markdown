A great deal is at stake: money; opportunity; time, relation ships, reputations. Often that brings out the worst in people as attempt to take advantage of the other side or try to look tough. So wouldn't we all be better off if there was a way to treat people fairly in a negotiation and get treated fairly in return? In the following pages we'll offer a simple, practical, field-tested approach that enables you to do just that. they egotiation is stressful.

The managerial bible on negotiation is Roger Fisher and William Ury's Getting to Yes. Published in 1981, it taught the world how to craft successful agreements by focusing on interests, not positions. But it left unresolved the messy problem of how to share the gains created. We propose that the answer lies in accurately identifying what's really at stake in a negotiation: the "pie;' which we define as the addi tional value produced by an agreement to work together. Its the value over and above the sum of the two sides' best alternatives to a negotiated agreement, or BATNAs.

## IDEA IN BRIEF

## THE PROBLEM

Our approach is based on one principle: The parties in a negotiation have an claim on the pie, so should split it. This is true regardless of what can accomplish on their own. Because an even split fundamentally changes how people look at power, there will be resistance\_espe-cially from those who benefit under the status quo. However, that resistance can be overcome, as we will explain: key equal\_ they they

When negotiators don't under stand the pie correctly; its much harder to reach agreement. they pie. split. they they

The pie framework will allow you to see a negotiation more clearly and more logically. It will help you make argu ments that persuade others by highlighting inconsistencies in their approach. And though it sounds simple\_perhaps too simple~we'llshow how it applies in a variety of increasingly complicated scenarios. But first let's look at a very basic example that explains the pie logic.

## POWER VERSUS FAIRNESS

Imagine that Pepe's will give Alice and Bob one of its famous 12-slice clam pizzas if can agree on how to divide it up. If can't, Pepes will give them half a pie, but with four slices going to Alice and two to Bob. Most people adopt one oftwo perspectives regarding how Alice and Bob might negotiate an agreement. they they

The first is the power perspective. Alice has more power her fallback of four slices is twice as big as Bob's\_which

## WHY IT HAPPENS

## THE SOLUTION

Negotiators focus on the total amount to be divioed, not on the value created by an agreement That leads to conflicting views on power anc fairness

Recognize that the gains to be shared are the additional value the agreement creates over and above the sum of the two sides' best alternatives. This negotiation pie should be divided equally; because both sides are equally essential to creating it.

## The notion of "dividing the pie" is commonplace in negotiations, but most people look at the wrong pie. The pie 'typically have in their heads is the total value available to be split they

suggests that she should get twice as much pizza: eight slices versus four for Bob. The second is the fairness perspective. In this scenario divide the total in half: Each gets six slices. they

Splitting the total in two is an oversimplified view of fairness. Alice and Bob are not in equal positions; she has a better fallback. If 6:6 were really a viable approach to fairness it should work for any set of fallbacks. It doesn't. Consider what would happen if Alice's fallback rose from four to seven slices while Bob's stayed at two. She'd reject the deal with the 6:6 split and keep her seven slices. We can see that as a rule for fairness, dividing the total value by two is fundamentally flawed, since it doesn't work for all fallbacks.

Neither approach is truly defensible. The power perspective confuses power outside the negotiation with power inside it. While 8.4 seems like a reasonable split because it mimics the ratio of the fallbacks, there's no inherent reason why the outcome should be based on that ratio. Some might argue that Bob is in a weaker bargaining position since he will get fewer slices than Alice if there's no deal, but that argument misses the point. If don't reach a deal, Alice will get nothing more than her four slices; just as Bob will get nothing more than his two. Effective negotiation is about beating your fallback. Alice and Bob need each other equally to do that and so are equally powerful. One can also see the weakness of the ratio approach by imagining a differently situated Bob who would get only crumbs if there were no deal. In that instance, mimicking the ratio of fallbacks would lead to an absurdly high proportion of slices going to Alice. Bob could reject that deal at almost no cost. Because Alice still couldn't beat her fallback without his agreement, Bob could hold out for more of the gains.

Our principle points to a new way to divide the 12 slices. If Alice and Bob reach an agreement, they'll have six more slices than would without one. That increase is what we've defined as the negotiation pie: the additional value created by the deal. Both Alice and Bob are needed in equal measure to get it. Alice does not have a greater (or lesser) claim than Bob over it. Correctly understood, both power and fairness dictate that the six extra slices should be split evenly; with Alice keepher fallback of four slices and Bob his fallback of two. This means Alice ends up with seven slices and Bob with five. they ing

Simply reframing negotiations in terms of our definition of the pie is a big step forward. Without it, the norm is a sim ple power or fairness heuristic that varies with the situation

and who is making the proposal. The results are offers that appear fair to the side making the proposal but not to the other. Our approach provides one consistent framework that is fair to both sides and reflects their equal power.

## FAIR INTERESTS?

Anju and Bharat were celebrating the holidays together. After dinner, Bharat turned to Anju for some financial advice. He couldn't decide how to invest his money. The stock market was volatile: So he was considering putting $20,000 into a one-year CD at 2% interest, which would net him $400.

The two quickly agreed that it made sense to pool their funds and invest together: With a bit of online searching; Anju found could get a better rate\_3%~if purchased a 825,000 CD. Now had to figure out how would divide upthe $750 interest. (Seethe exhibit 'How Is the Pie?") they they they they Big

Anju had the same problem. She had been planning to a one-year S5,000 CD. Because she had a smaller amount to invest, the bank was offering her only a 1% rate. While SSO in interest was better than nothing, it wasnt that much better. buy

Bharat presented what he thought was a fair solution and what pretty much all our MBA students propose: Each of them would earn 3% on the money invested. Anju would S150 in interest (3% on $5,000), while Bharat would get S600 (3% on $20,000). Bharat was dividing the S750 in proportion to the money invested, much like dividing the pizza slices in get

## How Big Is the Pie?

This chart compares the interest payoffs Anju and Bharat could earn as they decide whether to invest together to a CD. Teaming up will create a negotiation pie total interest on their combined investment (S750) less the sum of what could have each earned investing separately (8450).

proportion to the fallbacks. This, he argued, was fair because the two were getting the same interest rate

In response to the pie argument, Bharat pointed out that without his help, Anju would be stuck at S50. She should be happy to make $150. Anju was ready for this. Without her help; Bharat was stuck at S400 in interest. He was asking for the one greedy. being

But was it fair? Anju saw things differently: Investing together would create S300 in value. The two of them were able to earn $450 before decided to their funds; teaming up would increase that total to $750. Anju was equally responsible for the $300 increase. She wanted the S5O she could earn on her own plus half the extra value created by the deal, or $200 in totalthey pool

At this Bharat offered to split the difference between his proposal and hers and give Anju S175 in interest. Halfway between unfair and fair is still unfair, so Anju wasn't ready to give in. "Bharat, she said, "imagine for a moment that a $25,000 CD pays the same 2% interest rate as a $20,000 CD, sotheres only S5OO to divide. It would still make sense for us to invest together in that scenario; since it would lead to an extra SSO from getting 2% interest on my S5,OOO contribution rather than 1%. But it wouldn't make sense for under the scheme you proposed, where we would each earn 2% on the money invested. That means you would still get $400, and I would begoing up from $50 to S100.I would be getting all the That wouldn't be fair to you. Instead, Id split the extra S50 with you:" (See the exhibit "How Is the New Pie?") point you gain. Big

It was game over. Bharat realized that he couldn't askto pick proportional division in one setting where it favored him but then reject it in another where it didn't.

Bharat's original proposal, equal interest rates; sounds fair because it treats all the dollars involved as the same. But Bharat's dollars could earn 2% on their own, while Anju's could earn only 1%. Their dollars aren't really the same. Before the two sides figure out how to split the total, each side must first be compensated for what he or she could earn alone. Then the excess return should be divided equally. The S300 is equally reliant on the two parties, not propor tionally reliant on the amounts contributed. gain

You can certainly change a deal outcome by finding an alternative partner. Bharat might team up with someone else

with a $5,000 investment and work out a better deal than hed get with Anju, who couldn't as easily find a better deal with another $20,000 investor.

If, say; Chiragh will invest $5,000 with Bharat and take his 3% offer, then Bharat can earn S600 on his $20,000. That's an improvement for Bharat, but it could still make sense to do a deal with Anju\_especially if Chiragh won't accept anything less than $150.

Anju would have to undercut Chiragh, but she could hold out for more than the S5O shed earn on her own. If Bharat does the deal with Chiragh, he will earn $600, and Anju will the $750 Anju and Bharat could make together. That's the new diminished pie. Anju could offer to split that S1OO with he collects $650.

Bringing other parties into a negotiation changes the pie and what each side ends up with. If Anju and Bharat are the only two people who can come together to make the deal possible, the pie is $300, and Anju, even with the worse present, its a new negotiation with different fallbacks and a smaller pie, but Anju and Bharat still split the pie.

## THE CONTRIBUTION TRAP

Anju and Bharat's highlights a critical issue in negotiations: People have a hard time seeing equality when parties what look like very different contributions to the table. And often people don't appreciate that they're getting less than half the Our next two examples look at negotiations where there is a presumptive split that is uneven but should not be story bring pie.

Buying an apartment. In the taking out a mortgage pays a 1.8% recording tax on mortgages below S500,000 and 1.925% on mortgages at or above S500,000. That ends up alot of money. But the tax code makes it possible to reduce the bill by doing a CEMA~a consolidation; extension, and modification agreement. Under a CEMA, the buyer takes responsibility for the seller's mortgage and deducts the mortgage amount from the sales price. This decreases both the buyer's recording tax and the New York state transfer tax the seller owes, which is 0.4% of the city being price.

## How Big Is the New Pie?

Let's say that Anju and Bharat can combine their funds to a 825,000 CD at 2%. In this scenario the interest rate is the same one Bharat would get if he invested alone Buying the CD together would still create additional value because Anju's funds would earn higher rate: The total interest would increase from $450 to $500; the additional $5O is the negotiation pie that Anju and Bharat should split equally. buy

<!-- image -->

Consider a case where the buyer is planning to take out a S1 million mortgage and the seller has an existing mortgage of S600,000.If the buyer were to take over the seller's mortgage; the recording tax would then apply only to the new part of the to $7,200, just over $12,000. Meanwhile, with the new; lower sales price, the seller would save $2,400 in transfer tax saving

Sellers accept the default split all the time. shouldn't. Both parties are equally responsible for the tax savings. The CEMA works only if the seller has an existing mortgage. The buyer has to get her lender to agree and the seller has to give permission to his lender too. The savings should be split 50:50,or $7,200 to each. Savvy sellers know to ask for a payment that divides the pie evenly They

All told the CEMA would save $14,400 in taxes. That is the pie. Yet few buyers and sellers see themselves contributing equally to it. The buyer thinks she is creating S12,000 in savings while the seller sees himself creating $2,400. Consequently; the seller accepts an uneven split according to the default tax savings for each side: $12,000 to S2,400,or 5:1.

A merger of equals. In standard merger-of-equals agreements; the parties split synergy in proportion to their premerger sizes. Heres an example loosely based on an actual proposed merger. Two industry giants, Adelaide and Brisbane; could achieve large cost savings by consolidating their overlapping operations. Under the status quo, Adelaide has a market capitalization of $240 billion; and Brisbane's is $160 billion. If merge in a stock-for-stock deal, their combined market capitalization will be 8430 billion; with the extra 830 billion representing the joint cost savings. gains they

<!-- image -->

## Our approach stillapplies even when the size of the pie is uncertain, the parties see very different pies; or have reputations at stake they

In a merger of equals, each side retains its proportionate share in the combined enterprise. Since the size ratio of the companies is 60.40,Adelaide will end up with 60% of the new and thus 60% of the S30 billion; or $18 billion. Brisbane will get the other 40%, or $12 billion. Adelaide will garner 50% more of the gains because it was 50% larger. entity

Many professionals think this is a perfectly reasonable outcome. We disagree. Its true that if Adelaide walks away, there will be no deal and the full $30 billion will be lost. But its equally true that if Brisbane walks away, there will be no deal and the full $30 billion would be lost. There is no sense in which Adelaide is more important to realizing the cost savings. Since their contributions are equal, the split of the pie should be too: Each should get $15 billion.

One solution would be for Adelaide to pay $3 billion up front to the Brisbane shareholders. That, added to their 40% of whatever gains arise from the merger (which should be S12 billion) , would their total to $15 billion; the same amount that Adelaide shareholders would expect from their 60% of the gains after the S3 billion payment. There's still a risk that the won't come out exactly as predicted, but the risk is limited to 10% of the total (the $3 billion payment) That isn't zero risk, but it is manageable. bring gains

However; to determine the right payment, the two sides must have a similar view of the potential pie. And while could agree in principle that their contributions are equal, might still disagree about the size of the pie. With mergers and many other kinds of deals, correctly calculating the pie means knowing what the two sides can accomplish together and on their own; which may require them to share confidential information. they they

If the relevant numbers in adeal are hidden or hard to confirm; it creates the potential for bluffing and misrepresentation. In some of these situations, especially mergers, the parties may choose to reveal the numbers. All the facts were on the table in the actual negotiation on which the Adelaide-Brisbane example is based, a proposed merger between the mining giants BHP and Rio Tinto. Far from trying to keep its estimate of potential synergies hidden, BHP publicized it. The company wanted to provide shareholders; regulators, and the public with its rationale for the merger. The pie was relatively easy to estimate since there were no comparable options to create synergies with other firms. The fallback values were just the two companies' valuations prior to the merger. Ultimately, though, there was no pie because the European Commission blocked the deal.

## BUT WHAT IF

So far, we've focused on deals where the parties agree on how to value the pie and aren't looking beyond the one deal. Our approach still applies even when the size of the pie is uncertain; one side cares more about the pie, or the 'parties have reputations at stake-

Who is more responsible for those savings? Coke is its vast purchasing power to the table, but is it contribut more than the start-up? bring ing ing

The size of the pie is uncertain. When a consumer products company; say Coca-Cola, partners with a start-up; it can use its buying power to greatly reduce the cost of packagLet's assume Coke can cut the start-up's cost for a plastic bottle from 19 cents to 11 cents. For a start-up with sales of 100 million bottles a year, the savings would be $8 million annually. But if the $8 million pie were split in proportion to firm revenues, the result would be quite lopsided. Cokes share could well be 2,000 times as big as the start-up's. In that case; Coke would get $7,996,000 and the start-upS4,0OO! large ing

No. Coke's clout is essential, but it needs the start-up's customers because it has already harvested all the savings on its own bottles. For Coke to create $8 million in additional savings, it must find someone who is paying too much for bottles and needs a lot of them. It's only by putting Cokes purchasing power together with the start-up's customers that S8 million can be saved. The two sides are equally essential, and therefore the savings should be split evenly: S4 million to each

People often resist the idea of equal power when one party is agreat deal bigger than the other. Many believe that the larger party is better positioned to find an alternative

But this ignores the uncertainty: The size ofthe pie is an estimateto discover the start-up's sales are 50 million bottles. A good solution here is to split the pie as its created. If Coke provides the bottles at 15 cents each, rather than 11 cents, then Coke and the start-upeach 4 cents a bottle. This way evenly split the pie whatever size it turns out to be. being gain they

partner. That's not always the case. Coke could certainly find another start-up; but the start-upcould just as easily approach Pepsi, which might offer it a deal at 15 cents a bottle, improving the start-up's fallback from 19 cents a bottle to 15 cents. Coke could still bring value to the table by offering 11 cents a bottle, but the pie would shrink from $8 million to S4 million since the additional savings would be only 4 cents a bottle on 100 million bottles. In this case the pie should again be split 50.50.If the start-up's fallback is now 15 cents a bottle it should get $2 million or pay 13 cents a bottle to Coke. The start-updoes even better.

One side cares more about the pie. The biggest objection people have to our approach is this: What if one party cares more about the outcome than the other?

Lets go back to Coke. When a start-up is negotiating with a large established firm, the money involved will be life changing (if not lifesaving) for the start-up but not material to the big player. The player will use that asymmetry to argue that the small player should be happy to accept less than half the pie, since even a modest slice creates a lot of value for it. Such thinking underlies the view that the larger party has more power in a negotiation. The larger player says, 'You need this deal much more than we do;" and the smaller side goes along. large

But any argument the larger party can make about getting more can be flipped into one for giving it less. If Coke contends it should get more because it cares less, the of the $8 million. Money matters a lot more to us, and you would hardly miss it. The $l million we are giving up feels like $7 million. So that's an equal sacrifice given how much more each dollar is worth to us.

We'll put some numbers on the Coke and start-up deal to illustrate the point. Let's say they're still negotiating over S8 million in savings, but the start-up cares seven times as much about each dollar. Coke will argue that giving $1 mil lion ofthe total savings to the start-up and keeping $7 million for itself leads both parties to achieve the same effective gain.

Our solution\_S4 million to each\_cuts through this impasse. The split doesn't depend on how much either side cares. The two sides value the $4 million differently but can agree that each is getting half the pie as it sees it. Each is halfway between getting its worst outcome (no savings) and its best outcome (all the savings). Even though the start-up cares more, it doesn't end up with less.

A reputation is at stake. Many negotiations are of a oneoff nature, but there are clearly situations where one or both sides want to develop a reputation for how negotiate. Even if Coca-Cola won't negotiate with the start-up again, it may care about how its perceived by other ventures it might do future deals with. they

We find that the concern over reputation generally reinforces equal-share outcomes. A party might be willing to agree to an unfavorable split in a one-off negotiation. But if its likely to be involved in similar future negotiations, it will not accept a disadvantageous deal, because it won't want to seen as an easy mark. In other circumstances one party might have the opportunity to end up with more than half the pie but refrain from seizing it out of concern that future potential deal partners wouldn't want to do business with it. be

WE FULLY APPRECIATE that most people don't negotiate in the manner we've discussed. We know our approach is novel. The pie framework reveals the otherwise-hidden equality of power. It will allow you to negotiate more logically and more clearly and make arguments that persuade others. It works whenever theres an opportunity to cooperate with another party to maximize the value you create together. It also works when negotiating with people who don't care about fairness. will have no counterarguments against the pie principle; and refusing to accept your case for equal division will them as inconsistent or intransigent and may cost them the deal. But you will have to hold firmly to this principle. They good paint

Because the pie approach is fair, it eliminates the tradi tional posturing that happens in negotiations. By resolving the issue of division, it frees parties to focus their energies on creating the biggest possible pie. HBR Reprint R2106H
