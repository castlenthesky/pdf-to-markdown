## Negotiate wich a Liar

obust social psychology R research indicates that prominent study found that people tell, on average, one or two lies every Negotiators are no exception. Judging from studies done in 1999 and 2005, roughly half of those making deals will lie when have amotive and the opportunity to do so. Typically they see it asa way to the upper hand (although it can actually cause backlash and prevent the kind of creative problem solving that leads to win-win deals) . Deception is thus one of the intangibles that negotiators have to prepare for and take steps to prevent. day. they

Tactics for getting to the truth by Leslie K. John

Many people assume that the solution is to get better at 'detecting deception. There's a widespread notion that one can reliably a liar through subtle behavioral cues-Or "tells;" in the parlance of poker and spot-

other games that involve bluffing: But the evidence doesn't support that belief. One meta-analysis (a study of studies) found that people can correctly identify whether someone is telling a lie only 54% of the time not much better odds than a coin flip. Even the polygraph-a technology specifically engineered to detect lies inacontrolled setting\_is riddled with problems and comes to the strangers have divulged secrets encourages reciprocation. In a series ofstudies that I conducted with Alessandro Acquisti and George Loewenstein; we presented readers of the New York Times with a list of unethical behaviors; such as making a false insurance claim and cheating on one's tax return. People who were told that 'most other participants" had admitted those were doing things

Humans are inept at recognizing lies that are cloaked in flattery Were wired to readily accept information that conforms to our preexisting assumptions or hopes wrong conclusion about a third of the time. Humans are particularly inept at recognizing lies that are cloaked in flattery: your boss's promise that a promotion is coming any day now; the supplier's assurance that your order is his top priority: We're wired to readily accept information that conforms to our preexisting assumptions or hopes.

27% more likely to reveal that had done likewise than were people who were told that only a few others had made such admissions. they

Is there anything you can do toensure youre not duped in a negotiation? Yes; if you focus on prevention rather than detection There are several science-backed strategies that can help you conduct conversations in a way that makes it more difficult for your counterpart tolie. Though these methods aren't fail-safe, will leave you better positioned in your deal making and help you to create maximum value they

## Encourage Reciprocity

Humans have a strong inclination to reciprocate disclosure: When someone shares sensitive information with us, our instinct is to match their transparency. In fact; simply telling people that others-\_even

Reciprocity is particularly pronounced in face-to-face interactions. In experiments led separately by Arthur Aron and Constantine Sedikides, randomly participants who worked their way through a series of questions designed to elicit mutual self-disclosure were more likely to become friends than were instructed to simply make small talk. (Onecouple assigned to the disclosure exercise eventually Inducing = aclose relationshipis not the primary goal of most negotiations; of course. But other research, by Maurice Schweitzer and Rachel Croson, shows that peoplelie less to those know and trust than do to strangers. paired pairs they they

A good way tojump-start reciprocity is to be the first to disclose on an issue of strategic importance (because your counterpart is likely to share information in the same category). For example, imagine you are 'selling a piece of land. The it will command depends on its developed. So you might tell a potential buyer that you want to sell the land for the best use. This could prompt her to divulge her plans; at a minimum, you are encouraging a conversation about interests, which is critical to creating mutually beneficial deals. This strategy has the added benefit of letting you frame the negotiation, which can enhance your chances of 'finding breakthroughs. price how

## 2 Ask the Right Questions

Most people like to think of themselves as honest. Yet many negotiators guard sensitive information that could undermine their competitive position. In other words, they lie by omission, failing to volunteer pertinent facts. FOr example; consider an individual who is selling his business but knows that vital equipment needs replacing\_a problem imperceptible to outsiders. It might seem unethical for him to withhold that infommation; but he may feel that by simply avoiding the topic, he can charge a higher \_ while still maintaining his integrity. ~Ifthe buyer had asked me, Iwould have told the truth!" he might insist. price

The risk of not getting the whole story is why it's so important to test your negotiating partners with direct questions. Schweitzer and Croson found that 61% of negotiators came clean when asked about information that weakened their bargaining power, compared to 0% of those not asked. Unfortunately, this tactic can backfire. In the same experiment, 39% of negotiators who were questioned about the infomation ultimately lied. But you can goa long way toward avoiding that outcome by posing your queries carefully. Research by Julia Minson, Nicole Ruedy; and Schweitzer indicates that people are less likely

tolie if questioners make pessimistic assumptions ("This business will need some new equipment soon; right?") rather than optimistic ones ("The equipment is in order, right?") Itseems to be easier for people to lie by affirming an untrue statement than by negating a true statement. good

## 3 Watch for Dodging

Savvy counterparts often get around direct questions by answering not what were asked but what wish they'd been asked. And, unfortunately; we are not naturally gifted at detecting this sort of evasiveness. As Todd Rogers and Michael Norton have found, listeners usually don't notice dodges, often because they 've forgotten what they originally asked. In fact, the researchers discovered that people are more impressed by eloquent sidestepping than by answers that are relevant but inarticulate. they

Dodge detection is improved, however, when listeners are prompted to remember the question-for example, when it is visible as the speaker replies. In a negotiation, therefore, it's agood idea to come to the table with a list of questions, leaving space tojot down your counterpart's answers. Take time after each response to consider whether it actually provided the information you sought. Only when the answer to that 'question is "yes" should you move on to the next issue.

## Dont Dwell on Confidentiality

Research shows that when we work to assure others that well maintain their privacy and confidentiality; we actually raise their suspicions, causing them to clam upand the National Research Council documented this paradox with potential survey participants: The greater the promises of protection; the less willing people were to respond. This relationship holds may upin experimental research. In studies conducted by Eleanor Hans-JÃ¼rgen Hippler, and Norbert Schwarz, for example, fewer than half of the people who received a strong confidentiality assurance agreed to complete an innocuous survey whereas about 75% of those given no such assurance 'agreed todoso. singer,

My colleagues and Ihave discovered that strong privacy protections can also increase lying. In addition; we've found that when questions are posed in a casual tone rather than a formal one people are more likely to divulge sensitive information. Imagine you are negotiating ajob offer with a prospective employee and would like to assess the strength of her other options: Does she have competitive offers? Shes likely to be more forthcoming if you avoid or at least minimize confidentiality assurances and instead nonchalantly broach the topic: all know there are tons of great firms out there. Any chance you might be considering other places?" Of course, you should still properly protect any confidential information you receive, but there's no reason to announce that unless asked. "We

## 5 Cultivate Leaks

People inadvertently leak information inall kinds of ways, including in their own questions. For example; suppose you are in charge of procurement for a firm and youreabout to sign acontract with a supplier who has promised to deliver goods within six months. Before signing, he asks you what happens in the event of late delivery. The question could be innocent, but it might also signal his worries about meeting the schedule. So you need to pay attention.

When people leak mindlessly; the information tends to be accurate\_ Astute negotiators realize that

Information exchange is integral to creating win-win deals, but it must be carefully managed. Disclose too much and your counterpart might take advantage of you; disclose too little and you miss opportunities to discover mutually beneficial trades. So what should you do when you're asked a question that, if answered truthfully; would put you at a bargaining disadvantage?

LIE. You will be tempted to lie. Don't. Setting aside ethical, moral, and legal arguments, if you get caught, it can damage your reputation and your relationship with your counterpart and potentially put the entire deal in peril . Research shows that many positive interactions are required to restore trust after a single breach, and breaches entailing deception are among the most difficult to recover from.

## WhaT To Do

PALTER. Another common but misguided approach is what Todd Rogers and colleagues call 'paltering;" or 'using truthful statements to convey an inaccurate impression. The researchers give re the example of former U.S. president Bill Clinton's answer to a question about whether hed had a sexual relationship Monica Lewinsky: "There is not a sexual relationship-that is accurate: Technically that statement was not a lie, because his involvement with Lewinsky was in the past. But research shows that people view such legalistic skirting of the truth as unfavorably as view outright lying: with ma they -

REDIRECT:. In the short term, the strategies deployed by politicians, who routinely face tough, direct questions, can be instructive-particularly for one shot negotiations (when you are unlikely to meet your counterpart again). A familiar tactic is to dodge the question by changing the subject to something seemingly related. As noted earlier; people are generally not very good at detecting dodges, so you have an opportunity to selectively disclose information of your choosing- A second strategy is to turn the tables and question the questioner. Responding in this way can deflect attention and enable you to take control of the topic.

SHARE CAREFULLY: If you're playing a longer game, disclosure can work in your favor; it can foster trust and facilitate better outcomes through collaboration and joint problem solving: To avoid being exploited, however; negotiators should start small: Share a substantive but not critical piece of information. Only if your counterpart reciprocates should you continue the tit for tat; disclosure without reciprocation leaves you vulnerable to your counterparts O(

ABSTAIN: A third common workaround is to abstain from answering the question. However, Kate Barasz, Michael Norton, and have shown that this tactic leaves a worse impression than disclosing even extremely unsavory information. For example\_ in one study; participants viewed people who had confessed to frequently : 'stealing items worth more than $100 as more trustworthy than those who had simply refused to answer the question: onal valuable knowledge can be gleaned simply by listening to everything their counterparts say; even seemingly extraneous or throwaway comments-in the same way that interrogators look for statements from criminal suspects that include facts not known to the public.

Even if your counterpart is determined to withhold information, you can still encourage leakage. In a series of experiments, my collaborators and I found that people are much more likely to let slip information about their engagement in sensitive behaviors than are to explicitly divulge it. In one study; we 'probed New York Times readers about matters such as Iying about their income. We directly asked people inone groupif = had ever engaged in specific activities. We took anindirect approach with the other group; participants to rate the ethicality of various behaviors themselves had engaged in the behavior and a different scale if they they asking using they ' they

com had not. Participants in the latter group were roughly 1.5 times likelier toadmit (tacitly) to bad behavior than were people asked point-blank about their conduct.

Ina negotiation; you might use similarly indirect tactics to glean information. For example, give your counterpart a choiceof two different offer packages\_two possible ways of dividing the both of which would be acceptable to you. If she expresses a preference for one over the other, she is leaking information about her priorities and giving you insight into her relative valuation of the issues up for negotiation. spoils -

Heres one more strategy that might encourage your counterpart toinadvertently show her hand: Request contingency clauses that attach financial consequences to her claims. If she balks at agreeing to them, it may be because shes lying: At a minimum; such a reaction should to prompt you probe further. Suppose, for example, that your business is negotiating the acquisition of a small start-up. Your counterpart gives you sales projections that strike you as optimistic or even impossible. You could propose a contingency clause that would tie the acquisition to the sales level achieved. That would motivate your counterpart to provide realistic sales projections, and it would protect you if shes wrong: price

LYING SURROUNDS USandcan be a real impediment to the creation of value in negotiation. The good news is that deploying science-backed strategies can goa long way toward bringing out the best in negotiations andin the parties involved.
