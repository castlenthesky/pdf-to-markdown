## Sources of Joint Gains in Negotiations

Individuals enter into an agreement only if each party is better off with that agreement than without it. Put differently, the agreement represents joint to each party relative to her Best Alternative To Negotiated  Agreement   (BATNA) when exist, a negotiator must possess a keen understanding of how joint are created. In this note, we discuss several potential sources of joint At one level, these sources can be viewed as a laundry list of joint possibility.  However useful such a list may we find it more insightful to view this list through two organizing principles: gains gains they gains gains. gains be,

Principle 1: Most joint are about differences . gains

Principle 2: Joint are created when all parties receive something valuable for them in exchange for giving something to them\_ gains cheap

It is often said that 'differences divide In negotiation; differences often enable agreement. To see this, imagine a world in which everybody is exactly the same: same tastes, desires , opinions, values , attitudes toward risk, etc. In this world, precisely because everything is worth exactly as much to me as it is to you, there is little opportunity for exchange.  Now let's return to our real world, a world of heterogeneity. In this note, we use these differences as the basic raw material and develop recipes based on Principles 1 and 2 that produce joint or "create value."1 We use simple examples to illustrate the basic analytical principles behind creation of these joint gains gains .

## Potential Sources of Joint Gains

## Differences in Interests

In their best-selling book, To Yes, Fisher and advise negotiators to "Focus on Perhaps the most common way of creating joint is by exploiting differences in interests . In a negotiation; interests manifest themselves in terms of issues, particular means of satisfying more fundamental   interests. For example, union and management may be Getting Ury gains

1 Note that Principle 1 reads that most joint are about differences . There are categories of joint that do not involve differences Sometimes there is no conflict on a particular issue: all want the same resolution of that issue\_ In this case, negotiators have certain "shared interests, e.g  in the reputation of the company, the organizational structure of a or in the relationship between the negotiating parties: In other cases, identical negotiators can achieve mutually beneficial economies of scale.

bargaining over the issue of work rules, but the underlying interests might be autonomy, personal satisfaction, etc. Management may well be able to meet their interests through changes other than changes in formal work rules.

Bob may more weight on interest X than interest Y, while Carol cares more about interest Y than interest X. This combination of interests suggests an agreement in which Bob 'gets his way' on interest X, while Carol her way' on interest Y. Both would be better off than with a 50-50 X-Y split. The following example further illuminates these basic ideas: put 'gets

Two small business   partners, Danielle and Evelyn, are  equally adept at accounting and sales. Danielle enjoys both accounting and sales, but prefers working with numbers to meeting with customers. Her partner, Evelyn, is indifferent to the accounting and responsibility for sales. doing taking

It is easy to imagine Danielle and Evelyn splitting the accounting and sales duties evenlyHowever, common sense dictates that Danielle should do the books, leaving Evelyn with the sales function.  Indeed, both Danielle and Evelyn are happier with such an arrangement than with splitting the tasks evenly. quite

To make these concepts clearer , imagine that Danielle and Evelyn have systems. systems are merely a convenient way of representing Danielle and Evelyn's preferences for one arrangement over another.2 If Danielle prefers arrangement X to arrangement Y, then Danielle should assign arrangement X more than arrangement Y. scoring Scoring points

We might envision three possible allocations of effort:  Danielle does all the sales and Evelyn does all of the accounting (Allocation A); Danielle and Evelyn split the accounting and sales evenly (Allocation B) , and Danielle does all of the accounting and does all of the sales (Allocation C). Evelyn

The system reflects Danielle's preferences for accounting over sales: She assigns 10 to spending 100% of her time accounting and only 4 to working full time on sales. The scoring system also reflects Evelyn's indifference to accounting and sales: Evelyn 10 both to spending all her time accounting and all her time sales. scoring points doing points assigns points doing doing

If Danielle and fail to explore their interests, each might end up working half-time on accounting and half-time on sales. A 50-50 split is worth 7 to Danielle, and 10 to Evelyn. Is there a better arrangement?   Sure. Since Evelyn doesn't care whether she does accounting Evelyn points points

2 We do not go into detail on how to create these scoring systems.

Sebenius , Analytics for Negotiators: Seven Dialogs ;" Dialog 5.

or sales , and Danielle strongly prefers to do the numbers , a much better division of labor is to have Danielle do all the accounting, leaving Evelyn to carry out the sales work. Such a division of work leaves Danielle and Evelyn each with 10 points, clearly better than if the activities had been split evenly.

Couples, business partners  organizations, and nations often craft agreements that exploit differences in how the value the interests In a may be diametrically opposed on all issues: the best resolution of an issue for Party A is the worst resolution of that issue for Party B, and vice versa. Still, there may be ample opportunity for an agreement. There is almost always some issue X that is less important to A than it is to B, and consequently another issue Y that is paramount for A and insignificant for B. Joint are created if issue X is resolved in B's favor, whereas issue Y is resolved in A's favor. Recall Principle 2 Joint are created when all receive something valuable for them in exchange for something for them . parties parties gains gains parties cheap

Recipe (differences in interests): Concede on an issue that is relatively unimportant to you (and relatively important to your counterpart) in exchange for a concession on an issue that you consider more important (and is relatively unimportant to your counterpart) .

## Differences in Opinion

Mark Twain wrote: "It were not best that we should all think alike; it is difference of that makes horse races. Individuals often differ in beliefs about what the future holds in store, whether those differences concern the future unit sales of a product, the of oil, the Yen-U.S. dollar exchange rate, the likelihood of a technological break-through, or the productivity of a critical research scientist. Divergent views are often implicit in the sale of a stock or a company from one individual to another: the seller believes that the stock will while the buyer believes that an increase in the of the stock is imminent. opinion Price drop' price Price

There are a number of reasons that   individuals may the likelihood of a critical event, including varying exposure to information or differences in how available information is interpreted.3 Whatever the reason for such differences , disagreements of this sort are raw material for joint in the form of contingent agreements, agreements in which the payments from one party to another party are contingent on a Particular event. Lets turn to an example that illustrates this basic idea: prior gains

Franklin Publishers is negotiating with Gloria Gill on rights for Gloria's latest novel. The two parties are at an impasse, largely because Gloria believes the book will be a best   seller , whereas Franklin's forecasts are more modest: Furthermore, neither side has been successful in convincing the other that their estimates are mistaken.

Franklin and Gloria may well fail to reach an agreement, each trying desperately to narrow the differences: Don't you see when you have a great opportunity? This book is destined to be a best seller, if I do say so "You're far too optimistic. It's just like Great Hopes , a novel which you might remember sold a puny 10,000 copies.' And so on. There' s an alternative: Franklin and Gloria can allow the disagreements to stand as are, differences about what the future holds in store\_ In turn, can these differences by constructing a contingent agreement. myself:. they exploit they

3 For an account of how probabilistic judgments are sensitive to informational cues, see Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman (1974), "Judgment under uncertainty:  Heuristics and biases ; Science 185, 1124-1131.

Suppose for simplicity that Gloria's book will sell either 50,000 (moderate seller) or 100,000 (best seller) Franklin believes that the probability of 50,000 books is .70, whereas the probability of Gloria's book becoming a best seller is .30. Gloria, of course, disagrees: she believes that it is more likely to be a best seller than a moderate seller . She assesses the probabilities of sales of 50,000 and 100,000 copies as .20 and .80 respectively. copies. selling

To illustrate a contingent deal, suppose that Gloria needs to a flat advance of $140,000 for her novel, or else she will her book elsewhere The most Franklin can offer is $120,000. Since Gloria wants $140,000, and the highest Franklin is prepared to offer is S120,000, there is no possibility of an agreement involving unconditional payments. There is, however, a deal involving conditional sells 100,000 copies. value to Franklin is now 70 (S100,000) + (.30) (S160,000) = $108,000, better than Franklin's maximum. For Gloria, the expected value of the new arrangement is 20 ($100,000) + (.80) ($160,000) = $148,000, which exceeds her minimum\_ There's a deal! get shop

What has happened?   Returning to Principle 2, we see that Franklin and Gloria each have exchanged something expected to be to one for something the other expects to be valuable: Since Franklin believes that the chance of 100,000 is only .30, it is not terribly costly for him to offer Gloria a higher sum in that event:.  In return, Franklin pays less, $100,000 if the book only sells 50,000 copies, an event that Franklin believes is likely. Gloria, on the other hand, is to take a lower minimum payment, $100,000, because she believes that there is .80 chance that she will actually receive an additional $60,000. In other words, each has exchanged something to her in expected value terms for something she judges to be valuable in expected value terms. Once again, we have an application of Principle 2 cheap selling copies quite willing cheap

Franklin and Gloria can both do even better by lowering the increasing Franklin's payment to Gloria in the event that Gloria's book is a best seller. The following payment structure has a higher expected value for both Franklin and Gloria.

|                              | Number of Copies Sold   | Number of Copies Sold   |                |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
|                              | 50,000 copies           | 100,000 copies          | Expected Value |
| Franklin's payment to Gloria | $50,000                 | $200,000                |                |
| Cost to Franklin             | 70                      |                         | $95,000        |
| Benefit to Gloria            | 20                      | 80                      | $170,000       |

In fact, mathematically , there are no limits to the expected value joint that can be created. In the following example, Gloria pays Franklin $5,000,000 in the event that her book sells 50,000 copies, but receives $5,000,000 if her book becomes a best  seller. Both Franklin and Gloria make money in expected value terms when the deal is structured in this fashion! gains

|                              | 50,000 copies           | 100,000 copies          | Expected Value |
| Franklin's payment to Gloria | $-5,000,000             | $5,000,000              |                |
| Benefit to Franklin          | 70                      | 30                      | S2,000,000     |
| Benefit to Gloria            | 20                      | 80                      | $3,000,000     |

does this arrangement seem so contrived and unrealistic?   First, agreements must meet the test of institutional plausibility . In this case, it seems so crazy for Gloria to pay Franklin $5,000,000 that we hope that neither party would partake of such an agreement, whatever the magnitude of expected value It is important to note that the efficiency of the scheme stems from which could occur outside the of this deal. The deal (or perhaps lack of an agreement in the absence of betting) gives both a legitimate reason to bet. Why gains . betting setting parties

A second problem with the last example is risk aversion. Gloria and Franklin might well be to make decisions on the basis of expected value for small stakes and even for   several hundred thousand dollars . But few would consider $5,000,000 small stakes. Most individuals and even most firms would think many times about risking that large a sum of money. In the next section, we talk explicitly about risk aversion and how differences in risk attitudes can be turned into joint willing gains.

Finally , some might object that these aren't real in the sense that it will turn out that one 7 party is 'right" and one party is Put   differently, some question whether   contingent contracts actually do create any economic value. To argue that such transactions do have economic value, we turn to the insurance business. Insurance, has a winner or a loser . Those who are unfortunate enough to suffer a fire are winners in the sense of made the 'right" decision to insure their house, while those whose house is not inflicted by fire made the wrong decision to purchase the policySomeone was 'right'" and someone was wrong' at the end of the policy's term. no economic benefit. Similarly, although contingent agreements have a "winner' and a "loser at the end, the contract serves an economic purpose: it has allowed a transaction to take place that might not have taken place otherwise. gains wrong too, having

The following recipe summarizes this section:

Recipe (differences in opinion): Create a contingent arrangement or "bet. Structure the agreement as follows:

If A believes that some event is less likely than B does , then A should pay B if that event occurs (perhaps 'compensating A with something of greater of value to A).

## Differences in Risk Preference

In the previous section; we assumed that everyone maximized expected value. However, we know that people often pay to avoid risk, whether by purchasing insurance or by sacrificing some potential "upside" for a bit more security    Naturally , there are substantial individual differences in the tendency to tolerate risk. Such differences can be exploited to create joint We turn to the following example: gains.

Two business partners, Hank and Ida, own equal shares in a venture that has a 50% chance of becoming a bonanza: If the venture goes bonanza, Hank and Ida will be rewarded with $1,000,000 in If the venture fails to g0 bonanza, the venture will just break even, producing no profits. profit.

Hank and Ida face a problem of how to divide the future proceeds of the venture: Suppose that unlike the book negotiation; there are not differences in opinion to exploit, only differences in willingness to tolerate risk. Hank is extremely risk averse, cautious in his personal and business expected value.

Suppose it is proposed that Hank and Ida each half of the proceeds, in all cases. In other words, Hank and Ida will each receive $500,000 if the venture bonanza, and otherwise. Is there a division of proceeds that would make both Hank and Ida happier? one that differences in risk preferences. Since Hank is risk-averse  suppose that he would be glad to take $100,000 for sure over the proposed alternative, a 50 chance at $500,000 and a 50 chance at $0. Whats left over goes to Ida: $100,000 in the event that the venture fails. Since Ida is to make decisions on the basis of expected value  this arrangement is worth $400,000 to substantially higher than the $250,000 expected value of the previous arrangement.  Hank was glad to trade the "upside potential" for some security. Again we see an application of Principle 2: Hank traded "something cheap' for 'something valuable. In turn, Ida assumes substantial additional risk but is rewarded with the possibility of a large potential payment. get nothing goes Yes, exploits willing her ,

|                | Venture Goes Bonanza 50   | Venture Fails_ 50   | Value    |
|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------|----------|
| Hank's payment | $100,000                  | $100,000            |          |
| Ida's payment  | S900,000                  | $-100,000           | $400,000 |
| Total payment  | $1,000,000                |                     |          |

## To sum up this section:

Recipe  (differences in risk preference): Transfer   risk to the party  who is more to bear the risk (and compensate elsewhere). willing

## Differences in Time Preference

Individuals or firms may have substantially different discount rates, a measure of how trade off consumption or money taken now with consumption or money taken in the future. Firms , for example, may differ in terms of the riskiness of the projects that are currently undertaking, as well as their access to capital markets or other sources of funds.  Individuals, too, may differ in their patience   liquidity, or their career stage. In this section, we illustrate how differences in time preference can be leveraged for the creation of joint We use the following example: they they gains.

Jersey Tool Company and Kennington Products have just agreed on a fiveyear contract in which Jersey will sell Kennington $10,000 in tools each for the next five year years.

A natural arrangement would involve annual payments of $10,000 from Kennington to Jersey. Let's suppose  that Jersey has a 25% annual discount rate. On the  other hand,   Kennington has a considerably lower discount rate of 15%. Are there any ways of restructuring the payment schedule to reflect these differences in time preference?

Let's first look at expediting the S10,000 payment in Year 1. To Jersey, 810,000 in Year 1 is worth $10,000/1.25 = $8,000 to Jersey now\_ current payment over $8,000 is better for Jersey than $10,000 in Year 1. On the other hand, the present value of a payment of $10,000 in year 1 is $10,000/1.15 = $8,696. Thus, Kennington would be to pay as much $8,696 to forego a $10,000 payment in Year 1. the two pieces together, Jersey and Kennington are better off if Kennington pays Jersey anything between $8,000 and $8,696 Any hapPy today Putting today-

Again,  the based on Principle 2 Expediting payments benefits Jersey more than it hurts Kennington. Of course, the general solution does not always involve expediting payments. If Jersey's discount rate had been 10% instead of 25%, then value would be created by delaying payments. The general idea is that when time differences exist, payments or benefits should be shifted (either moved up or pushed back in time) to reflect these differences.

Recipe (differences in time preference): differences in discount rates (and compensate elsewhere).

## Other Differences

There are a number of other types of differences that can be capitalized upon. Different tax rates suggest shifting income toward the party with the lower tax rate: Different and complementary capabilities  suggest a partnership alliance  in which all   partners are better off. If there are differences in motivation; perhaps deal should be structured to provide the less motivated individual with incentive payments.   If one party wants a "win" and the other care mainly about substance, create a press conference to announce victory for one side, leaving the "fine to the others.  In all cases, the creation of joint is based on Principle 2\_ public Parties Print" gains

## Summary

We have discussed several sources of joint gains, as well as presenting some basic principles that organize this list and can be used for identifying other sources of In practice, finding and exploiting joint is not a matter of luck or even simply a matter of skill\_thorough preparation is needed as well. Below we outline some steps in the preparation stage. gains. gains

First, construct a differences   inventory. Remember than common ground, are the raw material  for most joint Start by identifying and understanding your interests , attitudes  toward risk, your discount rate, as well as your beliefs about  critical uncertainties. As difficult as this task might must also do the same for your negotiating counterparts. Probe as much as possible, but don't be afraid to admit that you simply don't know. This might indicate an opportunity for collecting information the negotiation. gains . your be, you during

Second, envision agreements. What are the critical differences? What might deals based on these  differences  look like? deals? Coming to the negotiating table with an understanding of how to create allows you to control the negotiation process, create joint gains, as well as possibly the lion's share of the for yourself . gains grab gains

Third , identify what information you need. Whats from the differences inventory? You may very well not know how your counterpart feels about the of oil or the interest rate. You might not know whether she values autonomy or compensation more Your counterpart's cost of capital might be a complete mystery to you. The nature of the agreement you strike depends on the answers to these questions.  It should be obvious how important it is to learn about your counterpart:. When information is needed for agreements, it is critical to manage the process, fostering information sharing, and managing the tendency to escalate conflict:. You must also be aware of the or theirs For example, if one side misrepresents its discount rate, you might end up with a deal in which payments are expedited, when an efficient agreement calls for delaying payments. missing price crafting good
