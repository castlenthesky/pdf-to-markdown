## How do you feel?

## Rejected? Upset? Defensive?

We often perceive negotiations as conversations led by logic. But are, in fact, very emotional. Emotions are the language of our ego, an unconscious part of our brains that instinctively reacts to external events and that controls a number of our body's vital functions; including our breathing, temperature, and balance. Our ego is responsible for our survival it is what drives our fight-or fight reactions; or the impulses that have historically helped us hunt or avoid hunted. they being

While most of us no longer live under constant threat, we do encounter struggles. Our ego may still interpret conflict as a threat, which instinctively put us in a high-alert mode. This explains when a hiring manager says no, your ego is triggered, regardless of your experience level. And when this happens, you are more likely to react impulsively and based on negative emotions like fear, self-doubt; anger, resentment, or shame. why,

## How to Manage Your Emotions During a Negotiation

The news is that its possible to change your internal wiring and learn to better manage your emotions by building one skill: mindfulness. Mindfulness involves becoming more aware of your feelings in stressful situations; staying in the present; and moving forward without baggage. When you learn how to do this;, you will also learn how to clarity under stress and let go of your natural ego response. good gain

Like any other skill, mindfulness takes time, effort, and patience to master. Here's a four-step process to get you started.

## 1) Understand your triggers.

High-stress situations, like negotiations; often trigger us psychologically and take us back to moments in our pasts when we experienced similar emotions. These associations are typically driven by our egos but have very little to do with the event we are experiencing in the present. For instance, perhaps as a child, you were rewarded a star every time you got a high grade, and so you began to associate hard work with rewards. As an adult, when you don't get the salary you feel you have earned, you may unconsciously recall this experience and feel like a failure; spiraling into negative self-talk about your own worth. gold

Since associations like this are unconscious, it can be hard to recognize them\_ using the exercise below to figure out what's going on for you internally before your next negotiation: Try

- What if my manager says no to my request?
- What if say they dislike my proposal? they
- What if my manager is rude or aggressive to me during the negotiation?

For each question; think about how you'd organically react. As you work through the "what-if"' scenarios; dig deeper with a couple of follow up questions.

- What is my go-to response?
- Why do I have this response?

Do your best to be nonjudgmental with yourself as you go through this process. Its going to be emotionally draining, and the self-critical voices in your head will see your vulnerability and want to take over. But the point of this exercise is self-awareness so be kind to yourself as you work through it.

## 2) Plan for a different emotional response.

Once you have identified your unconscious emotional responses; you can think about how to manage them. Its best to do this is before you enter a stressful situation. In the case of negotiations, I suggest asking yourself a few additional questions based on the triggers you identified in the previous step.

- If I feel stuck in the middle of the conversation; what can I do?
- What are some ways to make my case without getting defensive?
- 66 If Ihear a what are two or three ways to react without feeling frazzled or dejected?

These guiding questions will help you prepare for difficult emotional responses in advance. For example; if you're prone to feeling anxious in situations where you're caught off-guard, make a list of all the ways a manager may surprise you and think about how you will respond. If you panic when you sense you're losing interest from your listener, practice maintaining eye contact or pausing and asking a question to redirect the conversation. You may even consider setting up a mock conversation with a friend to help you identify your stumbles; real time feedback, and hopefully, feel at ease. hiring gain

## 3) During the conversation, notice your triggers, and move on.

Even when you've done all the work beforehand, you're still probably going to be triggered at some point during the negotiation process. People are unpredictable and its impossible to prepare for every scenario that may come up. That said, there are ways you can respond and move past the difficult moments.

For instance; let's pretend the hiring manager rejects your salary proposal. You notice your begin to sweat, your jaws clench, and your heart rate rises. When this happens; pause. Take a deep breath. Inhale for a count of four and exhale for a count of eight. This should palms

help get you out of your own head and restore your body with a sense of calm.

Once you regain composure; think about what you practiced. Instead of letting your triggers threaten you, use them to brainstorm a new way forward. into your creative side and think about how else you can get what you want. Tap

Sticking with our current example; don't immediately assume that the hiring manager doesn't value your skills or expertise. Rather, approach the conversation from a place of curiosity. You don't know why the manager said no, gently nudge them for more information.

Lead with, "Could you help me understand why my request was turned down?" or "Im curious to understand what part of my request didn't resonate with you?"

You may learn that your salary expectation is outside their salary range for this position. Or maybe they didn't budget for the upper range that you're trying to Whatever the reason is, don't hesitate to probe further and fully understand where they' re coming from. The more details you gather, the easier it will be to move the conversation forward. In this your should be to close a deal or closer to one. get. goal step, get

You might, for example; consider that salary is not the only element of compensation. If your hiring manager hasn't budgeted for higher compensation; it may be worth your while to ask for other perks, including travel allowance; a signing bonus, or performance-based rewards. If finances are a priority, you might also inquire if the company would permit you to take up other freelance opportunities while in the job. asking: top Try

- Is there an opportunity for further negotiation; say after six months, in this position?
- Is there a policy on signing bonus for this position?
- Does the company give stock options as compensation for full-time employees? Would I be eligible for the same?
- Does the company pay for MBA or similar educational perks for their employees?

This creative exercise demonstrates to the employer your ability to pivot and be flexible with your strategy and the more you practice, the better you get.

Remember that emotions are natural during difficult conversations; but don't have to sabotage you. Instead, you can make a decision to lean into whatever you are feeling take what's useful to you (and others) and leave the rest behind. In the end, you have the agency to decide what to react what to embrace; and what to let pass. If you can learn how to do this, you can and will likely get closer to what you want. they to,
