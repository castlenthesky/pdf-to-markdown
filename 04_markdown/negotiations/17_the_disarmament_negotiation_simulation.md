## The Disarmament Negotiation Simulation

In the summer of 1966 the twenty-two students of the Doctoral Instruction Group (DIG) at the Harvard Business School were invited to play a negotiation simulation game as part of their Human Behavior in Organizations course. The primary purpose of the game was to simulate the process of nuclear disarmament and to draw from the simulation lessons about the process of negotiation in and resolution of conflict situations. The DIG was composed of all students entering Harvard Business School's DBA program: were to take six or seven preliminary business courses together. A number of the participants were not U. S. nationals; as Harvard ran a program for teachers at European; Asian and African business schools that utilized the DIG. They

The students were divided into two equal teams. Each team selected a team captain: Each team represented a country that possessed twenty nuclear missiles aimed at the other country. The game provided for ten periods; or turns. At a given period, each team would independently submit a decision regarding the number of missiles it would disarm. It could choose to remove two missiles, one missile or none. If a team removed two missiles at each turn; for each of the ten turns, it would be totally disarmed by the end of the simulation.

Alternatively, at any turn; either of the two teams could choose to launch an attack. Launching an attack would terminate the game. These decisions were transmitted in writing by the team captain to the course instructor. The course instructor, while observing both teams; would only take decisions in writing from the team captain:

In order to make the game something other than an academic exercise; each of the players was to pay 52.00 as an entry fee. The professor in the course collected the funds and used them as one source of payoffs for the participants. Payoffs were as follows: required

If no attack were launched, each participant would be S0.20 for each missile his or her team had removed at the end of ten turns. Thus, if a team had successfully disarmed all twenty missiles; each participant would receive S4.00. If neither party attacked, the was affected only by the level of missiles removed, and not on the actions of the other side paid payoff

If an attack were launched, participants on each team would be S0.10 per missile held, and an additional S0.20 per missile for each missile held in excess of the other would receive a of$1.50 for the 15 missiles held, and $2.00 for the ten missiles held in excess of Team B, for a total payoff of $3.50. Team B would receive S0.50 per participant. paid they payoff they they

At the beginning of the simulation teams were separated. Each team met for a few minutes to determine its basic strategy  Team A generally agreed that it would seek to disarm; and a negotiation team was dispatched to a neutral location to begin discussions with representatives of Team B. When the negotiating team returned, they informed the

captain of Team A that Team B had also indicated a willingness to disarm and that recommended that the first decision be to reduce their missile level by two. Both captains then submitted their decisions to the course instructor. they

Negotiations sessions took place at the beginning of each turn: The negotiators for Team A continued to report that Team B appeared to be sincere in its commitment to reducing the number of missiles; and Team A agreed at each turn as a group to continue its policy of disarmament.

At the tenth turn; the captain of Team A indicated to the course instructor that Team A chose to attack Team B Team A was armed, with twenty missiles, and Team B was fully disarmed, giving Team A an excess of twenty missiles. Based on the rules of the simulation; Team A was S6.00 per person; and Team B received nothing: fully paid

In the somewhat heated simulation debriefing conducted immediately after the announcement of the results; the Captain of Team A admitted despite the decision of number of missiles; leaving his team fully armed at all times. that,

In defending his decision; the Captain of Team A made the following points:

- 1 Captain was responsible for the decisions of her or his team. It was his job as Captain to help win the game for his team and maximize his team's earnings.
- 2 Had he disarmed and Team B attacked, his team could rightly hold him responsible for leading them into a failed strategy. By remaining armed and attacking at the last turn he assured his teammates of at least getting their back. money
- 3 No one on Team A had intentionally deceived Team B during the negotiations; as the captain of Team A had delegated the negotiations to other team members and never met personally with representatives of Team B; all members of the negotiating team fully believed that were disarming and negotiated in faith toward that end. they good
- 4 He had lied to his own team members in their best interest:
- a His lie put them in a position for a higher would only receive S4.00 ifboth sides had disarmed , but would receive S6.00 if launched a successful attack on a disarmed Team B. payoff. They 'they
- b His lie insured that no member of Team B could hold other members of Team A responsible for any deception; as only the Captain was aware of the strategy chosen.

- His lie increased the probability that Team B would believe the negotiators of Team A thus increasing the probability Team B would disarm.

The Captain of Team B argued otherwise. Had the teams been able to cooperate; would have both been able to achieve a positive financial outcome. The purpose of the exercise was to illustrate how cooperation might be achieved. By lying to both his own team and through them to the other team; the Captain of Team A had destroyed a valuable opportunity to build trust among the class and to demonstrate the value of cooperation: He stated that he was personally offended by the actions of the Captain of Team A. He argued that it would be difficult for him to trust his classmate in any of the numerous joint projects that would be working on together, and that he would have difficulty accepting the case comments of that individual in future discussions. His believed was that lying was ethically wrong even if it was allowed in the rules of the game. they they

## Questions for Discussion:

- 1 What motives might have prompted the Captain of Team A to engage in his deception of his teammates and Team B? What was the purpose of the deception? Was the deception of his teammates necessary for the strategy to work? Was the deception really 'lying' since it was allowed by the rules of the game? Crampton and Dees identify nine instances where deception is likely (text, PP. 47-49). Which of those are present in this disarmament simulation; and to what extent?
- 2 What would your response have been if you had been a member of Team B? What if you were a member of Team A?
- 3 Were the educational purposes of the simulation met? If you had been present at the simulation; what would you have learned about cooperation and negotiation?
- 4 The Captain of Team B was very emotional about what happened to his team:. How could you strengthen his arguments against the behavior of the Captain of Team A? Was the Captain of Team B at fault for deceived? being
