## Learning from Our Conflicts

Iused to think other people had conflicts but that i was immune. Then i came upon two inci dents in the life of the Prophet Joseph smith that completely changed my understanding of conflicts and forced me to admit I probably have as many as anybody else.

Perhaps a few hints will help. If you do think of a conflict or two, I you will jot them down. They they hope

What is a conflict? For our purposes a conflict is any situation in which both sides feel the other is in the today wrong:

1. It is strange, but unless we had a conflict in the last few hours, most of us don't remem ber our conflicts. This may be good, because it saves us but it creates a problem. if we don't remember our conflicts, we can't learn anything from them. pain,

- 7.a final proposition introduces my theme. When we remember our conflicts and reflect on them, are like mirrors that can teach about ourselves that are otherwise difficult to discover: If we permit them, our conflicts will show where we are weak, defensive, prideful, or otherwise in need of repair. they things

## First Example

FIl illustrate the value of conflicts with three examples. Two are from the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith. These both involve 0 liver Cowdery, who, at the time, was Joseph's most trusted associate. These conflicts occurred very close to each other in the summer of 1830, just after the Church was organized. Joseph was 24 years old, and 0 liver was 23.

Joseph was busy copying and arranging revelations for publication. 0 liver was staying with the Whitmer family in Fayette, 80 miles to the north. 0 ut of the blue, Joseph received à letter from 0 liver:

Joseph recorded:

[o liver] wrote to inform me that he had discovered an error in one of the commandments\_Book of Doctrine and Covenants: And truly manifest by their works that have received of the Spirit of Christ unto a remission of their sins" [D&amp;C 20.37]. they

The above quotation, [o liver] said , was erroneous , and added: "Icommand you in the name of God to erase those words, that no priestcraft be amongst us!

## The Prophet continued:

immediately wrote to him in reply, in which Iasked him by what authority he took upon him to command me to alter or erase, to add to or diminish from, a revelation or commandment from Almighty 2 God.

Doctrinally, 0 liver was wrong and Joseph was right. But knowing that doesn't solve the problem: These two trusted friends were now in a conflictboth felt the other was in the wrong; The doctrinal issue could be solved , but what about the bad feelings that had arisen between them?

r ealizing his letter had not really answered the doctrinal question and had made the interpersonal problem worse, Joseph traveled 80 miles to the Whitmer home to meet with 0 liver and the Whitmers\_

Joseph reported:

[ found the [Whitmer] family in general of [o liver's] concerning the words above quoted , and it was not without both labor and perseverance that I could prevail with any of them to reason calmly on the subject. Finally, with [Christian Whitmer' s] assistance , I succeeded in bringing, not only the Whitmer family; but also Oliver Cowdery to acknowledge that had been in error, and that the sentence in dispute was in accordance with the rest of the commandment. opinion they

Joseph then reflected on what he learned from this experience. His conclusions are the centerpiece of my message today:

And thus was this error rooted out, which its rise in presumption and rash judgment, was particularly calculated (when once fairly understood) to teach each and all of us the necessity 0f humility and meekness before the Lord, that He might teach us of His ways.3 having

Judging from his emphasis on humility and meekness, Joseph was commenting not only on 0 liver' s doctrinal error but also on the interpersonal conflict between them and, Ithink, on the nature of conflicts in general. With prophetic insight he taught two important

lessons. His first was that conflicts arise "in presumption and rash judgment:' Presumptuous means overconfident or even offensive. Rash means hasty or impetuous. With these definitions in mind , let us look again at 0 liver's message to Joseph. He said: "Icommand you in the name of God to erase those words, that no priestcraft be amongst us!"4 point

1 move to the next statement with trepidation, but Joseph invited us to consider the effect of his reply as well. Joseph "immediately wrote to [0 liver], what authority he took upon him to command me to alter or erase, to add to or diminish from, a revelation or commandment from a Imighty God. asking; "by7

Do you see any ways in which 0 liver's statement might be considered rash or sumptuous? Certainly commanding another person risks offensive, especially if it is your ecclesiastical leader. Commanding 'in the name of God" would raise offensiveness a degree or two. a your leader of craft would undoubtedly qualify. prebeing ccusing priest- a re there ways in which Joseph's words might have lacked "humility and meekness"? a t a minimum he might have responded with a comment and a question such as, " liver; love you and i value your Would help me understand your objection to this passage?" opinion. you

Joseph's second added power to the first. He concluded that '[conflicts are] larly calculated (when once fairly understood) to teach each and all of us. point particu -

Three ideas stand out in this statement. First, conflicts are particularly calculated to teach us something: second, we can't learn from them until are fairly understood, until we can see both sides meaning we need to cool off before we can learn from them. Third, in a mar velous illustration of his own humility; Joseph included himself as one who learned someimportant from this conflict. they thing

If our conflicts are particularly calculated to teach us something, what are we supposed to learn? Joseph's answer Conflicts are particularly calculated to teach us 'the necesof humility and meekness before the 1 ord, that He might teach us of His ways. deep: goes sity

We come to the ultimate question: What are the Lord's ways for with conflict? are illustrated in a second conflict between Joseph and 0 liver. dealing They did Joseph say humility "before the Lord" ? Why didn't he say "before the person on the other side"? To learn from our conflicts we must be to see our own faults , and we need the Lord's help to do that. 0 nly then can He begin to "teach us of His (emphasis added). Why willing ways"

## Second Example

Just a month after the first conflict, to escape persecution, Joseph and emma moved 80 miles north to the Whitmer home in Fayette the home Joseph had so recently visited to resolve the first conflict. a at the Whitmer home, Joseph was to learn that Hiram one of the eight witnesses to the Book of mormon, had been receiving revelations through a seer stone' that purported to give instructions on how the Church should oper ate n ewel Knight was with Joseph, and he described the seriousness of the problem: rriving grieved Page,

[Hiram Page] had managed to get up some dissension of feeling among the brethren by giving revela tions concerning the government of the Church which he claimed to have received through the medium of a stone he possessed . Even Oliver Cowdery and the Whitmer family had given heed to them.5

What could have been more painful and frustrating to Joseph than this? If Joseph had followed his earlier pattern, he would have demanded of Hiram Page by what authority he presumed to receive revelations for the Church, and he would have demanded of 0 liver what on earth he was thinking to believe in such

things. But Joseph was more aware that a hasty and intemperate response would not solve the problem. Joseph knew what not to do, but he wasn't sure what he ought to do.

n ewel Knight wrote:

Joseph was perplexed and scarcely knew how to meet this new exigency. That night I occupied the same room that he did and the greater part of the night was spent in prayer and supplication: 6

ather than react defensively; Joseph patiently sought counsel from the Lord. He granted an answer in the form of revelation, which is now section 28 of the Doctrine and Covenants.

## Doctrine and Covenants, Section 28

The Lord spoke in the first person directly to 0 liver: "behold, I say unto thee, 0 liver, that it shall be given unto thee that thou shalt be heard by the church in all things whatsoever thou shalt teach them The Lord's first words were an affirmation of 0 liver's standing in the Lord's eyes. Then He added this stipulation: by the Comforter; concern the revelations and commandments which have given. good ing section 28 is well known for answering the question of who can and who cannot-receive revelation for the Church. It is also a model of willingness to see wrongdoers in the larger context of their lives and to show divine confidence in them while reproving or correct them. ing

à fter clarifying that only the prophet can receive revelation for the Church, the Lord reaffirmed His divine confidence in o liver: "a nd if thou art led at any time by the Comforter to by the way of commandment unto the church, thou mayest do it."8 a nd He outlined the limits on 0 liver's authority: But thou shalt not write by way of commandment, but by wisdom; a nd thou shalt speak then, again, not command him who is at thy head, and at the head of the church."9

The 1 ord then turned to the source of the problem: Hiram Page. Iam struck that He with the same concern for Hiram's feelings as He had shown for 0 liver' s This exemplifies the Lord's way; and it makes it much easier for Hiram to accept correction: "Take thy brother, Hiram Page, between him and thee alone, and tell him that those things which he hath written from that stone are not of me."10 spoke instructed and corrected in this and reaffirming way; both 0 liver Cowdery and Hiram Page recognized their error and continued in full fellowship in the Church for a while.

## Third Example

These two events in the life of the Prophet Joseph prepare us for one other scriptural example the painful misunderstanding between moroni and Pahoran in a Ima 59 through 62. i wonder if this is where the Prophet Joseph his own understand that conflicts are meaningful and we must learn from them gained ing moroni is one of the military leaders in all of scripture. a t the early age of 25 he was made captain over all the n you will recall, when the prophet mormon abridged the records of moroni's military leadership, he called him "a man of a understanding' "11 and honored him with this remarkable endorsement: great ephite perfect

If all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold , the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have over the hearts of the children of men. power

Behold , he was a man like unto Ammon and even the other sons of Mosiah, yea, and also Alma and his sons , for were all men of God.12 they

it has always astonished me that this same mormon included, as of his abridged record, a vivid account of Moroni' s conflict with Pahoran; the chief judge and governor of the n part ephites.

a $ we learn in a Ima 59, moroni's army was caught in a dangerous situation. 1 amanite rapidly gaining ground them\_ a s chief military leader; moroni wrote Pahoran for reinforcements. r eceiving none, the scripture reports , moroni was angry with the government, because of their indifference concerning the freedom of their country:"13 against

We are treading sacred ground here. is there any question whether the 1 ord had inspired moroni to know there were problems at the government level that called for military help? n ot at all. However, in his abridgment, mormon made it clear that moroni mistakenly assumed Pahoran was of the problem and threatened to remove him as head of the government:. part

When no came from the government, Moroni wrote Pahoran He began with the facts: the suffering of his men, the slaughter of thousands of the n people, and other atrocities of war: but Moroni didn't realize that Pahoran had been driven from his throne by the king-men and forced to take refuge in Gideon, and moroni wrongly accused Pahoran of a traitor to his own country: moroni concluded with these challenging words: "Behold, the I ord saith unto me: if those whom ye have appointed your governors do not repent of their sins and iniquities, ye shall g0 up to battle against them."14 help again. ephite being

Ihave puzzled many Mormon would include a detailed account of this uncharacteristic error by the Captain moroni. i expect it was for at least two reasons why years great

0 ne would be to show us that none of us , not even the great Captain Moroni, is immune from presumption and rash judgment. What a comfort it is to me, and i hope to you, that we are in the best of company when we make errors of this kind. This is not to excuse them but to give us permission to admit our mistakes and to learn from them

The second reason is to show us one of the best examples in all of scripture of how to respond to an unjust accusation. We know very little about Pahoran except that he was an upright ruler committed to standing fast in that liberty in which God made us free."15 in chapter 61, mormon, as editor, us Pahoran's entire response to Captain moroni 1 will quote only two of the 20 verses included in his answer: gave

I, Pahoran, who am the chief governor of this land , do send these words. Behold , I say unto you , Moroni, that Ido not joy in your great afflic tions , yea, it grieves my soul.

And now, in your you have censured me , but it mattereth not; Iam not angry, but do rejoice in the greatness of your heart.16 epistle

How did Pahoran do it? How could he respond in such humility and meekness before the Lord? He probably sat right down and wrote an angry reply, venting his injured feelings against Moroni. If so, when he was finished, he did what we all must do he tore it up and threw it away Then he must have spent hours in supplication to the Lord to find the strength to overlook the unjust accusations and to reply with such compassion and love long even in this misjudgment moroni is also our model. When he learned of his error, he was not prideful. He immediately marched to the aid of Pahoran, and with their combined forces overthrew the king-men and the 1 amanites, and peace was restored in the land. they

in Proverbs we read that 'grievous words stir up anger' and "a soft answer turneth away wrath."17 Pahoran's soft answer is a beauti ful example of what the Prophet Joseph said about 'the necessity of humility and meekness before the Lord, that He might teach us of His ways."18

a s you reflect on these examples, do call to mind any other gospel principles? Im thinking in particular of that favorite scripture, ether 12.27: they

And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if humble themselves before me , and have faith in me, then will Imake weak become strong unto then. they they things

President Kimball taught this gospel principle in terms of mirrors. He said, ur vision is completely obscured when we have no mirror to [show us] our own faults and [we] look only for the foibles of others."19 "0

edward e 'dinger; a wise psychologist, wrote this about mirrors:

[a mirror] shows us what we otherwise cannot see for ourselves because we are too close to it. Without a mirror, for instance , we would never even know what our face looks like; since we are inside lookout, there can be n0 self-knowledge , even the elementary self-knowledge of what we look like , unless there is some device that can turn the light back on us.20 ing

## Final Observations

Iconclude with a few final observations about conflicts. a more could be said, but you will understand. gain,

1. Conflicts are easy to into but difficult to out of. if we have the courage to face them early are easier to resolve and to learn from get get they

2. Conflicts can be dangerous, because easily fly out of control. need containers such as friendships and solid marriages to hold them in. early detection helps. they They good good
3. There are plenty of conflicts. are also if we don't learn from one, thats wait a while, and, sure enough, the conThey cyclical. okay;

flict will come around and again until it either destroys a relationship or we learn next level of conflict, higher up on the plane of progression ) again

- 4 often worse before better. But it is generally better to face the problem now than to wait for the next time around Things get they get
- 5.its cruel that it should be this way, but the we re supposed to learn about our selves is usually obvious to the in conflict with thing person

6. even when we are right, we may be wrong- even when we are right-or especially when we are right\_if we are presumptuous and rash, we will give offense and become a stumbling block to others.

7. We learn by experience; but experience is not a very teacher unless we remem ber our conflicts. It is a mark of greatness to remember and to learn from our conflicts. good

## Conclusion

We should think of our conflicts as mirrors that reflect back upon us things about our selves we would rather not know: a s we learn in ether 12.27, it is a gift from heaven to be shown our weakness. If we will reflect upon our weakness , as the Prophet Joseph did upon the 1 ord will make us strong where we are weak. his,7

Ipray we may learn from our conflicts, that the 1 ord may teach us of His ways. in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
