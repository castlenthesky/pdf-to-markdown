## NEGOTIATING WITHOUT A NET

A Conversation with the NYPD' s Misino

EGOTIATION informs all aspects N of business life. interaction-with customers, with suppliers, and even with partners   and investors involves some kind of negotiation. In fact; in some languages the same term is used for both "business" and "negotiation"But the costs of failure can be high. The breakdown of negotiations between Hewlett-Packards management and its founding families; for example, the company's future in doubt and led to an expensive proxy fight. Every put simulations of Negotiation 101 don't do enough to prepare businesspeople for the really tough negotiations-the ones where failure is not an option.

Perhaps it's not surprising; then, that the last 20 years have seen an endless stream of handbooks on business negotiation; many of them best-sellers. Or that most of the country's top business schools have entire academic departments devoted to the subject. The advice is often helpful, even insightful. Who could argue with the recommendation that negotiators look for mutual and know their best alternative to a negotiated agreement? But you cant help feelthat the scholarly ink and classroom gain\_ ing

So where can you look for guidance? For the last three decades; the New York Police Department has been training officers in hostage negotiation; arguably the highest-stake situation of all. Founded in 1972, in the year after the Attica State Prison riot, the NYPD program was the country's first such training program. Another year later; in the wake of the Munich Olympics hostage crisis, the FBI established its own program, which was modeledonthe NYPD's. most law enforcement agencies in this country and others provide some kind of negotiation training, as local and national law enforcement officials face bargaining with armed criminals; terrorists, and psychopaths as part of their daily reality Today

Since retiring in 1995, he has taught negotiating skills to law enforcement officials, military personnel; and business executives (for more details, see his Web site, hostagenegotiation.com). Misino modestly describes hostage negotiation as " 'applied common sense" In the following interview; edited for clarity and length, he explores what he means by that innocuous-sounding term, painting a vivid picture of the blood, sweat, and tears of hostage negotiation.

## What special skills does it take to be a crisis negotiator?

don't think it requires special skills. Anyone can do it, man or woman, uniformed or civilian. What crisis negotiation does take is what I call applied comconstantly asking myself; What is the simplest [can doto solve the lem?" When I'm dealing with an armed criminal, for example, my first rule of thumb is simply to be This sounds trite, I know; but it is very important. thing prob polite:

A lot of times; the people Im dealing with are extremely nasty. And the reason for this is that their anxiety level is so high: A guy armed and barricaded in a bank is in a fight-or-flight mode. Todefuse the situation; ['ve got to try to understand what's going on in his head. The first step to getting there is to show him respect, which shows my sincerity and reliability So before the bad guy demands anything, I always ask him if he needs something: Obviously Vm not going to him a car. Im not going to let him go. But it makes excellent sense get to be sensitive to the other guy's needs. When you give somebody a little somehe feels obligated to give something back. That's just good comthing you

## Don't you find it difficult to be polite to a murderer or a rapist?

1ll go even further. How do you show respect to a convicted child molester? Believe me, in my line of work we routinely deal with people who have moved out of society and done that are just horrific. Obviouslyit isn't easy to negotiate with someone you dislike-but if you're a professional you keep your feelseparate from your work. things ings advantage that your goal is constantly right in front of your face: Get everybody out alive. And you're also under incredible time pressure. When an Ethi opian national hijacked that Lufthansa plane, [ had less than 45 minutes to build a relationship with him and bring the plane down. There were 104 people on board, and the hijacker had a gun aimed at the pilot's head. That's all the motivation [ needed to focused on my task.Of course, there are whole countries,even-who say that we should never negotiate with certain individuals terrorists, for instance. But  think that's extreme. In reality; we're always ready to negotiate as hard as we can with anyone to show him that there is an alternative to violence. Of course, we're also ready to come in with a tactical solution to deploy the SWAT teamsif we have to. But, ideally; force is a last resort. stay people -

## Can you give other examples of what you mean by applied

common sense?

Another very commonsense technique is to ask the bad guy very early on in a negotiation if he wants you to tell him the truth. [ stumbled on this tactic when 1 first started negotiating: My backup team found out that the bad guy had "Look, you grew up on the streets. So did I. Do you want me to lie to you or tell the truth?" And he said he wanted the truth, which, of course, is exactly what [ expected him to say His situation was desperate; there were snipers all over the place. Who in his right mind would have wanted to be lied to?

The critical you get by asking the other guy if he wants the truth is that he enters into an agreement with you right at the start. This is important because a successful negotiation is really a series of small agreements. You use every possible opportunity to agree with your adversary-and to get hin to agree with you. Because all the while you're agreeing the other guy is learnthat he can trust you, that nobody's going to hurt him. So [ try right away to to the first yes; and then immediately [ g0 for the second. / tell the bad guy that if he wants me to tell him the truth, then he might hear things he doesn't want to hear and, if that to agree not to hurt anybody. In my ['ve negotiated with hostage-takers, hijackers, and murderers; the majority of them have given me their word won't hurt anyone. These people may be the outcasts of society; but do have a code of honor. In fact, I would say that over 90% of the times that a criminal has given me his promise, he has kept it. thing ing get hap got day, they they

## If you don't have to learn

special skills; do you need certain personal qualities to be a successful high-stakes negotiator?

On the most basic level, you have to be a listener. Unfortunately; like most people; negotiators want to talk and be heard, and so they've to learn how to let the other person express himself without interruption. That's terribly important because the individuals with whom we are dealing are often the very people who have never been listened and are desperate to be heard. They just don't have the patience for you to butt in and make a mistake To around this, [ to be a very active listener. For example, I typically ask the other guy to tell me his side of good got they to, get try

And then I sit back and get an earful. I hear every instance of when the other guy has ever been wronged. discover how no one has ever cared for him. And a lot of this is true. But the way And that's what matters. things.

So negotiators are excellent listeners. But also need to be aware of the noise inside their own heads. Believe me, even if you don't know what's going on inside you; the other guy will. Their sensitivity to your own biases is extraordinary You need to know your hot buttons and your limitations. top they emotions; identifying them, and helping the other guy to work them through. One of the most effective ways of this is by a technique we call mirroring: We echo the other guy's remarks to and build a bridge between us. For exdoing try gun:"

And typically the bad guy says; "Yeah, have a gun?

- "Yeah; he says, "a nine-millimeter gun"

"A gun?" 1 repeat.

And echo him  again: "ninemillimeter?"

"Yeah, nine-millimeter with two magazines, 18 rounds:"

Personally; Ive a lot of trouble dealing with pederasts and other people who harm children. But nevertheless I got

In this exchange, of course, Im critical data. But at the same time Pm telling the bad guy that there is no get ting

"You can really infuriate people by trying to identify know that you know very little about what they've been through: they can negotiate with these people because [m aware of my feelings. [ would even say my feelings me to become a better negotiator because when [ know that something is going to affect me, I work harder to achieve a level of objectivity: That's all part of comfortable with who you are,which is essential for able to negotiate. Take negotiations: They are impromptu and can g0 on for 50 minutes or ten hours; nobody knows. The only for certain is that no one can sustain a facade under that kind of pressure for very long. So the best preparation in the world for a successful negotiation is just to be comfortable with yourself: push being being police thing

longer a gun separating him and me; instead, there is some vital piece of infor mation that the two of us share. In this way mirroring is the beginning of a real conversation.

## Your reference to active

listening sounds very reminiscent of what psychoanalysts call empathic listening: Can you say more?

Almost by definition; crisis negotiation is a roller coaster of emotions, both yours and the other To active listening means attuned to those guy's me, being

Another active-listening technique is to be constantly on the alert for the feelexpressed behind the words. This is not as obvious as it sounds. My for mer partner once had an elderly woman who had barricaded herself in a house with a ten-inch butcher knife, and she was cursing at him at the of her lungs. Despite her profanity; my partner was able to detect something else. He saidto 'Martha, [can your hear it in your voice:" And she went from ranting and raving to absolute silence. No one before had ever picked up on the fact that she was hurting much. When my partner acknowledged her pain; she down the butcher knife, and he could begin to treat her like the elderly grandmother she was. being ings top her; hear pain. put

It sounds hokey until you've experienced it, but the very act of listening is empathetic. And when we do talk, we to reinforce the empathy by a lot of"we" statements: "We're in this together" or "We can work this out:" This is the kind of language that can alleviate the bad guy's isolation and paranoia. using

## It sounds as if you' re trying to yourself in the other guy's put

shoes. Is that right?

Upto a point; but you've to be careful about telling a hijacker or a rapist that you know exactly what he's going through, because usually you don't. In fact, you can really infuriate people by trying to identify with them, because know that you know very little about what they've been through in their lives. One time, one of our guys tried to commiserate with a bad guy, and the guy just went ballistic. He started cursand screaming: "When was the last time you ever held up a bank and took five hostages?" So putting yourself in the other guy's shoes isn't always as helpful as it sounds. In fact, Fve often been struck in my own negotiations by how impossible it is for me to imagine the amount of stress a bad guy feels when hes holed up in a building with 100 heavily armed SWAT team officers focused on him, watching his every move. Truthfully; I have probably never felt as scaredor angry or lonely in my entire life as that guy does at that moment. got they ing

## You've talked about good

negotiators; what makes a bad one?

The worst negotiators are the people who hate rejection. Of course, nobody likes rejection it hurts your feelings. But bad negotiators can't accept the fact that all the negative stuff coming at them is not personal. think the other guy is angry at them when the other guy doesn't even know them [used to yelled at all the time in my job, but as [ tell my students; you just have to let the other person vent. Because if you do, there's an incredible They get payoff.

First of all, the other guy usually feels better. But even more important, in the process of letting off steam, the bad

guy is likely to tell you his problem and the solution to his problem. For instance I once heard a bad guy ranting and raving because a negotiator was Italian. That helped us figure out pretty quickly that the negotiator had to g0. But generally speaking bad negotiators lack this perspective. their feelhurt, which makes them soft or defensive. Both are bad positions from which to negotiate. They get ings

## So the other guy needs to vent: What about you?

Certainly you experience a lot of negative emotions in this job. You feel rage and frustration; you are almost always scared. I once participated in a negotiation that went on for 12 hours, though 1 wasn't the prime negotiator all that time. The most frustrating was that the guy refused to talk. He just recording of the negotiation; and whenever [ hear it feeling: out and strangled that guy; I probably would have part

There's nothing wrong with having strong emotions during a negotiation, but you need to acknowledge them so you don't act them out. That's the rule of thumb. But even here there are some exceptions. The most aggressive Fve ever said in a negotiation situation was to a burglar who was threatening to kill his hostage, an 84-year-old lady named Ruth. As his threats grew more intense, I felt rage coming up inside me. And Isaid tothe guy; "If you touch a hair on her head, I will personally ID your body in the morgue:" Now; threatening your hostage-taker is not a suggested negotiation tactic. But in this situation; my told me that if I sat there all Iistening to this particular guy threaten this particular lady he was going to kill her. So [ had to intervene. I did, and instantly the criminal backed down\_ thing day gut

That was the only time I ever threat ened a criminal in this way, but at the same time [ must admit that [ do not believe the best negotiators never act on their find yourself some risks in this job if you don't find yourself going someplace you never intended on g0ing-then you probably aren't being the best negotiator you can be. taking

It seems that you have to a lid on some strong feelings. What helps you do that? put

Having a team behind you is essential. Back in the early there were no negotiation teams. Negotiators worked one-on-one, and the stress was extraor dinary The longest consecutive negotiation [ever did was nine hours, and that was like running the New York City one could survive an ordeal like that without team support. days;

Nowadays, most police negotiation teams consist of five people. There is the primary negotiator; who actually talks to the bad guy. Then there is the commander; who makes all the decisions; and the coach who provides moral support and backup. These are the primary who runs around gathering vital information; and a guy we call a scribe. He keeps a chronological of all the important stuff that's going on during the negotiation: It sounds crazy; but one of the you often forget in the heat of a hostage situation is the other guy's name. So the scribe writes that down in big black letters on a piece of paper; which he tapes to the wall of the house or apartment we're negotiating out of. log things

An   important about these teams is that 're deliberately set up to separate negotiation from decision making, which gives the primary negotiator both terrific relief and enormous power to negotiate. Imagine for a ment that you're negotiating and you tell the bad guy that you're in charge. He responds by demanding a car in 30 minutes or he'll take out a hostage. If, on the other hand, you can say; "Look, my commander is in and [ have to consult him; you've bought yourself time to maneuver. point they'

This is the way diplomats operate all the time. work out a proposal and They then it back to the national lead ers for uation you don't have and months to discuss a proposal. You don't even have minutes. You come to a fork in the road, and you have fractions of seconds to decide whether to g0 right or left. This kind of pressure would be unendurable without a team's direction. bring days

guess that a lot of the time you didn't meet the people you were dealing with face-to-face Was that a problem?

hate to say it, but face-to-face communication is very old-fashioned. We rarely dothat nowadays. Originally the NYPD agreed with the communication gurus who said that face-to-face negotiation creates more intimacy and trust. But we quickly found out that face-to-face communication with a psychopath or an armed criminal is highly dangerous. In fact; the only police negotiators who have ever been killed in a negotiation situation were those who had face-toface contact. So we dropped the approach altogether except for those situations in which there is absolutely no other way

There is another reason we don't communicate face-to-face: We don't want to have the other guy see the inner machinations of our team. Think about what the scribe does, for example. If by some chance the bad guy would even surmise that someone is writing down information about him, he might not just feel

Normally we prefer to work with the other guy by phone. Either we a phone line or a into the bar ricaded zone. However we manage it, phone contact is extremely effective. Americans are totally comfortable with the phone. We argue on the phone; we drive and talk on the phone; Ive even heard of people who do therapy on the phone. Ironically, in my experience; the bad guys are often more comfortable on the phone than in face-to-face contact because feel safer at some distance from the police. If they' re standing in the same room with you, feel more exposed. tap drop phone they being they

insulted; he might feel threatened. After all, if you have someone who's barricaded or holding hostages; hes going to be highly paranoid about his safety

## What's the most dangerous

negotiation situation?

Generally speaking; suicide is the most dangerous situation because its the most volatile\_ There's no suffering for people who are threatening suicide. By the time get this far, have finished suffering So unlike criminals who are a jail term, suicidal people fear nothing; They're not worried that might be punished for what they' re to themselves-or to you. They're just not thinking: And, as weve seen with the suicide bombers in Israel, that makes them some of the most danger ous people we could ever deal with. they they facing they doing

Once I had a suicidal ex-police officer who had climbed to the of the Whitestone Bridge. A lot of people who saw her said, "Aw; she's up there just because she wants the publicity:" But Inever believed that. It was clear to me that she had emotional problems. Her therapist came to the scene after [ had talked her down; and he told the team that we had handled her perfectly because we understood intuitively how top dangerous she was. In fact, he told us, she was not only suicidal; she was homicidal. 'She wouldn't have hesitated, if you made mad, to one of you and take you over the bridge with her:" Incidentally; suicide is the main reason we never allow a priest or a rabbi to talk to a bad guy We have learned over and over that when people ask for are virtually always looking for closure on their lives. Its a prelude to suicide. her grab clergy; they

## What's the biggest lesson you have learned from your work as a crisis

negotiator?

1 don't know if its the biggest lesson; but one very important you learn as a negotiator is that if you want to win, you have to help the other guy to save face. Look at the people I deal with. They' re criminals. They' re not book-learned. Yet they're very smart in the sense that can survive in an environment where most of us cannot, and also have their own kind of dignity  If you can show these guys a way to maintain their pride while fac a defeat know is inevitable, they'll g0 along with what want. thing they they ing they you

1 learned that lesson early in my negotiation career when I was called in to deal with a situation in Spanish Harlem. It was a hot summer night; and there were 300 or 400 people out on the streets at three oclock in the morning: Ayoung man with a loaded shotgun had blockaded himself inside a crowded tenement building; He told me he wanted to surrender but couldn't because he'd look weak

Now this guy was a parole violator; not a murderer; and so Itold him that if he calmed down and let me cuff him, [ would make it look as if 1 had to use force: He down his gun and behaved like a perfect gentleman until we got to the street; where he started screaming like crazy and raising hell, as we had agreed. While he was doing this, the crowd was chanting "José! José! "in wild approval, and we threw him into the back of the car; jumped on the gas, and broke into a huge grin; and said to me, man, thank you. 1 really appreciated that:" He recognized that I had given him a way out that didnt involve killing people and being killed in turn [ve never forgotten that. put sped "Hey
